This identifies 'efficient' moves where less effort (volume) is required to move the price, signaling a lack of selling pressure.\n                Concise Knowledge: In physics-based instrument data, if price momentum is positive while volume acceleration is negative (decelerating volume), it indicates a 'path of least resistance' where institutional buying has exhausted available supply; when this occurs under low price volatility, the trend is more likely to persist than high-volume 'noisy' breakouts.\n                concise Specification: The factor is defined as: (TS_PCTCHANGE($close, 10) / (1 + (TS_MEAN($volume, 5) - TS_MEAN($volume, 10)) / TS_STD($volume, 20))) / (TS_STD(TS_PCTCHANGE($close, 1), 10) + 1e-6).

While the theoretical framework remains compelling, the empirical results (IC: 0.0073, IR: 0.745) underperformed the SOTA (IC: 0.0090, IR: 1.166). The 'Quiet_Institutional_Markup_Factor' utilized a complex denominator involving volume acceleration and price volatility, which may have introduced noise. The 'Volume_Contraction_Efficiency_Factor' used a regression slope (REGBETA) to penalize volume, but the short 5-day window might be too sensitive to daily fluctuations. The 'Path_Least_Resistance_Index' offered a simpler approach but likely lacked the precision to distinguish between true institutional markup and simple liquidity exhaustion.",

The divergence between volume and price is a subtle signal; the current use of raw volume means and standard deviations in the denominator may be creating extreme values that degrade the Information Ratio. The hypothesis needs to move away from complex ratios and toward more robust indicators of 'effortless' price movement.",

        "reason": "The previous factors were penalized by high complexity in their volume-acceleration components. By switching the focus to 'Efficiency'—defined as the ratio of price change to turnover—and incorporating the high-low range as a proxy for volatility, we can capture the 'path of least resistance' more cleanly. Using turnover (volume/shares outstanding) or volume rank instead of raw volume averages will improve cross-sectional stability. A simpler, more robust formulation will reduce the risk of overfitting observed in the current complex iterations."

However, while the risk-adjusted performance (Max Drawdown) improved, the Annualized Return (0.0751) and Information Ratio (0.8561) slightly lagged behind the previous SOTA (0.0763 and 0.8665, respectively). The implementation of 'Volume_Intensity_Adjusted_Return_10D' and 'Institutional_Conviction_Efficiency_Z' suggests that normalizing volume intensity is a valid approach to identifying high-conviction trends, though the current scaling constants (e.g., +2.0 or +1.0) may be dampening the signal's sensitivity too much.",

The results suggest that assets achieving price gains with lower relative volume (high efficiency) tend to have better forward-looking performance.

The current additive constants (1.0, 2.0) are arbitrary; a more robust approach would be to use the cross-sectional median of volume intensity to ensure the denominator is always well-behaved without over-dampening the signal."

The results show a significant improvement in Information Coefficient (IC) and a reduction in Max Drawdown (MDD) compared to the SOTA, suggesting better risk-adjusted stability and predictive accuracy at the individual asset level. However, the Annualized Return and Information Ratio (IR) still lag behind the SOTA, indicating that while the signal is 'cleaner' (higher IC), the magnitude of excess returns captured by the current weighting scheme is lower.",

The 'ZScored_Trend_Efficiency_VPC_Rank_20D' and its variants successfully improved the IC (0.0062 vs 0.0059) and significantly mitigated tail risk (MDD -0.095 vs -0.114). This confirms that rank-normalizing the volume component helps in 'mitigating tail risks' as theorized. The use of TS_ZSCORE in the third factor likely contributed to the stability, but the overall return profile suggests that the interaction between the two components (Efficiency and VPC) might be too restrictive, potentially filtering out some high-alpha opportunities.",

By shortening the price efficiency window to 5 days while keeping the VPC confirmation at 20 days, we can identify price breakouts earlier while still ensuring they are backed by sustained institutional volume patterns. Additionally, replacing the multiplicative interaction with a non-linear combination or a conditional gate (e.g., only applying the VPC rank if it exceeds a certain threshold) may prevent the signal from being overly dampened in stocks with moderate volume-price correlation."

By refining the denominator to specifically reward price growth during volume contraction (negative volume slope), we can better distinguish between the start of a trend and its retail-driven peak.
