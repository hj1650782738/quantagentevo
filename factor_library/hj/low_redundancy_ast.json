The regime composite (combining intraday volatility, lower shadow strength, and pure price volatility) appears effective for signal enhancement but needs refinement for better risk control.

This addresses the current implementation's weaknesses while preserving its core insight: regime-dependent signal scaling enhances mean-reversion timing.

This suggests the regime-adaptive approach can capture stronger signals (higher return/IC) but at the cost of increased risk (worse drawdown) and lower risk-adjusted returns (lower IR).

The higher annualized return and IC suggest the regime-adaptive scaling successfully amplifies signals in high-volatility states, capturing stronger predictive relationships. However, the worse drawdown and information ratio indicate the amplification may be too aggressive, leading to excessive risk-taking during volatile periods. The regime composite (combining intraday volatility, lower shadow strength, and pure price volatility) appears effective for signal enhancement but needs refinement for better risk control. The price-volume divergence scaling shows promise but may benefit from asymmetric scaling (amplify more in high volatility, dampen more in low volatility) rather than linear multiplication.",

        "reason": "The current implementation shows promise but suffers from complexity (multiple components combined linearly) and aggressive signal amplification. The new hypothesis simplifies to: 1) Binary regime classification reduces complexity while maintaining regime adaptation; 2) Asymmetric scaling (different multipliers for high vs low regimes) should improve risk-adjusted returns by being more conservative in low-volatility states; 3) Dynamic threshold adjustment based on market conditions should make the regime detection more robust. This addresses the current implementation's weaknesses while preserving its core insight: regime-dependent signal scaling enhances mean-reversion timing. The simplification should reduce overfitting risk while maintaining or improving the strong annualized return and IC."

        "observations": "The current experiment tested two components of the proposed regime-aware dual-source momentum hypothesis: Institutional_Momentum_Score_20D and Retail_Herding_Divergence_10D. The results show mixed performance compared to SOTA. The combined factors achieve a higher annualized return (0.078 vs 0.052) and higher IC (0.013 vs 0.006), which suggests better predictive power. However, they show worse risk metrics: higher max drawdown (-0.114 vs -0.073) and slightly lower information ratio (0.963 vs 0.973). The third component (Volatility_Adaptive_Regime_Score_15D) was not implemented, so the full hypothesis cannot be fully tested. The implemented factors appear to capture some useful signals but may be missing the regime-adaptive weighting mechanism needed for optimal risk-adjusted returns.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results provide partial support for the hypothesis. The improved annualized return and IC suggest that combining institutional and retail momentum signals has merit. However, the deterioration in risk metrics (higher drawdown, lower information ratio) indicates that without proper regime-adaptive weighting, the combined signals may amplify risks during turbulent periods. The hypothesis likely requires all three components (institutional momentum, retail herding, volatility-adaptive weighting) to work effectively together. The current implementation shows promise but needs the missing volatility regime component to fully validate the hypothesis.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show potential but have complexity issues that may lead to overfitting. The Retail_Herding_Divergence_10D factor has high symbol length and multiple nested operations. A simpler approach should: 1) Use price-volume correlation over 20 days as institutional momentum, 2) Use 5-day average intraday returns as retail attention proxy, 3) Weight these signals by a simple volatility regime indicator (e.g., ratio of recent to historical volatility). This maintains the core dual-source concept but reduces complexity significantly. The simpler formulation should improve generalization while capturing the regime-dependent behavior hypothesized."

The results show mixed performance compared to SOTA. The combined factors achieve a higher annualized return (0.078 vs 0.052) and higher IC (0.013 vs 0.006), which suggests better predictive power. However, they show worse risk metrics: higher max drawdown (-0.114 vs -0.073) and slightly lower information ratio (0.963 vs 0.973). The third component (Volatility_Adaptive_Regime_Score_15D) was not implemented, so the full hypothesis cannot be fully tested. The implemented factors appear to capture some useful signals but may be missing the regime-adaptive weighting mechanism needed for optimal risk-adjusted returns.",

The improved annualized return and IC suggest that combining institutional and retail momentum signals has merit. However, the deterioration in risk metrics (higher drawdown, lower information ratio) indicates that without proper regime-adaptive weighting, the combined signals may amplify risks during turbulent periods. The hypothesis likely requires all three components (institutional momentum, retail herding, volatility-adaptive weighting) to work effectively together. The current implementation shows promise but needs the missing volatility regime component to fully validate the hypothesis.",

        "reason": "The current factors show potential but have complexity issues that may lead to overfitting. The Retail_Herding_Divergence_10D factor has high symbol length and multiple nested operations. A simpler approach should: 1) Use price-volume correlation over 20 days as institutional momentum, 2) Use 5-day average intraday returns as retail attention proxy, 3) Weight these signals by a simple volatility regime indicator (e.g., ratio of recent to historical volatility). This maintains the core dual-source concept but reduces complexity significantly. The simpler formulation should improve generalization while capturing the regime-dependent behavior hypothesized."

The simpler Institutional_Retail_Momentum_Dual_15D performed reasonably but only captures part of the idea. The volatility-weighted approach showed promise. We need to: 1) Drastically simplify the factor to <150 characters, 2) Focus on price-volume momentum alignment as the core signal, 3) Add simple volatility regime adaptation, 4) Use only 2-4 base features instead of complex nested functions. This approach maintains the core idea of regime-adaptive momentum while reducing overfitting risk."

        "observations": "The current experiment tests three separate factors derived from the regime-adaptive behavioral reversal hypothesis. The results show mixed performance compared to SOTA. The combined factors achieved a higher IC (0.00799 vs 0.00580), indicating better predictive correlation, but underperformed in risk-adjusted returns (Information Ratio: 0.59 vs 0.97) and annualized return (0.0426 vs 0.0520). The maximum drawdown is worse (-0.0944 vs -0.0726). This suggests that while the individual factors capture some predictive signal, their combination or implementation fails to translate into superior portfolio performance. The factors appear to be capturing different aspects of the hypothesis but not effectively integrated.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis of combining sentiment-driven price-volume divergence with deteriorating fundamentals and event anticipation shows partial validation through improved IC. However, the current implementation as separate factors fails to achieve the regime-adaptive and combined synergistic effects hypothesized. The deteriorating fundamentals component (FSI_20D) uses only inverse volatility, which is too simplistic. The event anticipation component (EAC_20D) uses simple price-volume correlation without regime adaptation. The behavioral reversal component (BRS_5D) captures sentiment but lacks integration with other signals. The hypothesis needs refinement in how these components are mathematically combined and dynamically weighted.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors are too simplistic and disconnected. The improved IC suggests the core idea has merit, but the implementation needs integration and regime adaptation. The new hypothesis simplifies the approach by focusing on two core components (sentiment + stability) with dynamic weighting. This addresses the complexity issue while maintaining the theoretical framework. The regime adaptation can be implemented through a volatility-based switch (e.g., using market volatility to adjust lookback windows or weighting). The factor should be expressed in under 150 characters to avoid overfitting."

        "observations": "The current experiment tested three factors derived from the same theoretical framework of institutional order flow imbalance, retail sentiment, and bid-ask spreads interacting under volatility regimes. The combined results show mixed performance: while the IC (0.008463) is higher than SOTA (0.005798), indicating better predictive correlation, the risk-adjusted metrics (information ratio, max drawdown) are worse. The annualized return (0.050827) is slightly below SOTA (0.052010). This suggests the current factor implementations capture some predictive signal but suffer from higher risk and worse risk-adjusted returns. The factors appear overly complex with multiple nested operations, which likely contributes to the performance gap.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support. The improved IC suggests the core idea—combining OFI, sentiment, spreads, and volatility regimes—has predictive merit. However, the deterioration in risk-adjusted metrics indicates implementation issues, likely due to overfitting from excessive complexity. The factors use multiple nested functions (RANK, SIGN, multiplication of multiple components), long lookback windows (5D, 10D, 20D), and conditional operations, which increase model complexity without proportional performance gains. The volatility regime scaling, while theoretically sound, may be implemented too crudely (simple multiplication) rather than as a dynamic weighting mechanism.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors are over-engineered. The core predictive signal likely comes from the OFI-sentiment interaction, not the complex multiplicative combinations with spreads and elaborate volatility composites. Simplifying to 2-3 core components reduces overfitting risk. The new hypothesis proposes: 1) Remove the spread component, which adds noise and complexity. 2) Replace the complex volatility regime composite with a simple volatility measure (e.g., 10-day return STD). 3) Use additive rather than multiplicative combinations to reduce nonlinear interactions that may overfit. 4) Shorter lookback windows (3-5 days) to capture more recent microstructure effects. This maintains the core theoretical premise while drastically reducing complexity, targeting a factor expression under 150 characters."

        "observations": "The current experiment tested three factors derived from the same theoretical framework of institutional order flow imbalance, retail sentiment, and bid-ask spreads interacting under volatility regimes. The combined results show mixed performance: while the IC (0.008463) is higher than SOTA (0.005798), indicating better predictive correlation, the risk-adjusted metrics (information ratio, max drawdown) are worse. The annualized return (0.050827) is slightly below SOTA (0.052010). This suggests the current factor implementations capture some predictive signal but suffer from higher risk and worse risk-adjusted returns. The factors appear overly complex with multiple nested operations, which likely contributes to the performance gap.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support. The improved IC suggests the core idea—combining OFI, sentiment, spreads, and volatility regimes—has predictive merit. However, the deterioration in risk-adjusted metrics indicates implementation issues, likely due to overfitting from excessive complexity. The factors use multiple nested functions (RANK, SIGN, multiplication of multiple components), long lookback windows (5D, 10D, 20D), and conditional operations, which increase model complexity without proportional performance gains. The volatility regime scaling, while theoretically sound, may be implemented too crudely (simple multiplication) rather than as a dynamic weighting mechanism.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors are over-engineered. The core predictive signal likely comes from the OFI-sentiment interaction, not the complex multiplicative combinations with spreads and elaborate volatility composites. Simplifying to 2-3 core components reduces overfitting risk. The new hypothesis proposes: 1) Remove the spread component, which adds noise and complexity. 2) Replace the complex volatility regime composite with a simple volatility measure (e.g., 10-day return STD). 3) Use additive rather than multiplicative combinations to reduce nonlinear interactions that may overfit. 4) Shorter lookback windows (3-5 days) to capture more recent microstructure effects. This maintains the core theoretical premise while drastically reducing complexity, targeting a factor expression under 150 characters."

All three factors are implemented and tested individually. The combined results show significantly underperformance compared to SOTA across all key metrics. The annualized return is only 0.3% vs SOTA's 5.2%, information ratio is 0.04 vs 0.97, and IC is slightly lower at 0.0053 vs 0.0058. The max drawdown is worse at -11.3% vs -7.3%. This suggests that either the individual components are ineffective or the combination methodology needs refinement. The factors are relatively simple with symbol lengths under 100 characters, so complexity is not the issue - the problem appears to be in factor design and signal quality.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis of a regime-adaptive, multi-source structural momentum factor is NOT supported by current results. The three tested components individually perform poorly. Volume-price confirmation (10-day correlation between volume changes and returns) shows weak predictive power. The 'governance persistence' factor is misnamed - it's simply inverse volatility, not a true governance measure. The adaptive volatility weighting doesn't improve performance when tested alone. The core issue appears to be: 1) The volume-price correlation may be too noisy at 10-day window, 2) The governance persistence factor doesn't actually measure governance, 3) The adaptive weighting alone without combined signals has no predictive power. The hypothesis needs fundamental refinement in both factor selection and combination methodology.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current results show that overly complex multi-source approaches with misaligned components perform poorly. The new hypothesis simplifies to two core, well-established momentum signals with clear economic rationale. Price momentum is a robust anomaly, while volume acceleration can confirm institutional interest. The adaptive weighting based on volatility regimes addresses the original hypothesis's regime-adaptiveness but with clearer implementation. This approach reduces complexity while maintaining the core idea of combining multiple signals with adaptive weighting. The factors should be tested with varying lookback periods (20, 40, 60 days for price momentum; 5, 10, 20 days for volume acceleration) and different volatility regime definitions (rolling percentiles, absolute thresholds)."

While the combined factor implementation demonstrates improvements in information ratio (1.088 vs 0.973), annualized return (7.83% vs 5.20%), and IC (0.0090 vs 0.0058), it suffers from significantly worse maximum drawdown (-13.85% vs -7.26%). This suggests the current factor construction is capturing some alpha but with higher volatility and risk. The hypothesis about cross-sectional supply-demand imbalance driven by information diffusion lags appears partially supported by the improved predictive power (IC), but the implementation may be too aggressive in its exposure to downside risk.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support. The improved IC suggests the factors are capturing meaningful predictive signals related to information diffusion lags. However, the severe deterioration in maximum drawdown indicates the current factor construction may be amplifying risks during market stress periods. The factors appear to be capturing alpha during normal conditions but failing to protect capital during downturns. This could be due to: 1) Overemphasis on recent price movements without sufficient risk controls, 2) Inadequate handling of extreme market conditions, 3) Potential overfitting to specific market regimes. The fundamental concept remains valid, but the implementation needs refinement to manage risk better.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show promise in capturing alpha (improved IC and annualized return) but fail on risk management (worse drawdown). This suggests the core hypothesis is valid but the implementation is too aggressive. The new hypothesis addresses this by: 1) Adding volatility normalization to make the factor more stable across different market conditions, 2) Incorporating volume as a confirmation signal to reduce false positives, 3) Using robust statistical measures that are less sensitive to outliers, 4) Balancing momentum and mean-reversion components. This should maintain the alpha capture while improving risk-adjusted returns. The focus should be on creating simpler, more robust factors that avoid the complexity pitfalls of the current implementations."

The simpler Stress_Amplified_Volume_Reversal_10D underperformed, suggesting volume-based signals need refinement. 3. The hypothesis framework shows promise (improved IC) but needs simpler implementations. 4. Future iterations should focus on: a) Simplifying the correlation-based approach drastically (<150 characters), b) Exploring pure volume/price-range signals without complex transformations, c) Testing shorter lookback periods (5-10 days) for faster mean-reversion capture."

The observed performance improvement comes from different factor constructions (momentum, volatility adjustment, correlation) rather than from governance-supply chain alignment. To properly test the hypothesis, we need factors that incorporate: 1) Governance proxies (e.g., board independence, shareholder rights, ESG scores if available), 2) Supply chain centrality measures (e.g., customer/supplier concentration, network position indices), 3) Market regime filters (e.g., volatility-based stability indicators). Without these components, we cannot determine whether 'corporate governance quality signals aligning with supply chain network centrality' creates structural advantages.",

This suggests that momentum persistence during low-volatility periods is a profitable signal. However, these factors are complex (long expressions, multiple operations) and risk overfitting. The next iteration should simplify these concepts while exploring actual governance/supply chain data if available. If such data is unavailable, we should focus on simpler momentum-volatility combinations to avoid overfitting."

        "observations": "The current experiment implemented three simplified factors that partially capture aspects of the original hypothesis but lack the comprehensive multi-factor integration and regime-switching mechanisms described. The results show mixed performance: while the IC (0.006316) slightly exceeds the SOTA result (0.005798), all three risk-adjusted return metrics (max_drawdown, information_ratio, annualized_return) are significantly worse than SOTA. This suggests the current factor implementations are insufficient to validate the hypothesis about regime-adaptive returns enhanced by governance and supply chain centrality.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis remains largely untested due to implementation limitations. The current factors only capture isolated components: 1) Governance_SupplyChain_Momentum_20D is essentially a Sharpe ratio ranking, 2) Sentiment_Reversal_VolumeDivergence_10D measures price-volume divergence, and 3) Regime_Switching_Stability_Indicator_15D detects volatility regime changes.

This suggests: 1) The IC improvement comes from capturing some valid signal, 2) The poor risk-adjusted returns indicate either excessive risk-taking or missing risk management components, 3) The factors are likely too simplistic and miss critical elements of the original hypothesis. The factors have reasonable complexity (symbol lengths: ~100, 120, 150 characters respectively) but lack the sophisticated integration needed for the regime-adaptive behavior described. Future iterations should either: A) Implement actual governance and supply chain metrics using available data, or B) Focus on refining the regime-switching mechanism with available price/volume data before adding complex fundamental components."

        "observations": "The current experiment results show mixed performance across the three factors implementing the noise regime hypothesis. While the IC metric slightly improved (0.006103 vs 0.005798), all three financial performance metrics deteriorated significantly compared to SOTA. The annualized return dropped from 0.052010 to -0.000073, information ratio from 0.972561 to -0.000920, and max drawdown worsened from -0.072585 to -0.125692. This suggests that while the factors may capture some predictive signal (as evidenced by the IC improvement), they fail to translate this into profitable trading strategies. The complexity of the factors is moderate, with expressions ranging from 150-250 characters, which may contribute to the poor generalization observed in financial metrics.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results partially refute the hypothesis that noise-driven market regimes amplify order flow imbalance signals. While the IC improvement suggests the factors capture some predictive relationship, the dramatic deterioration in financial performance metrics indicates that: 1) The noise regime filtering may not effectively identify profitable trading opportunities, 2) The order flow imbalance signals may be too noisy or poorly constructed, 3) The combination methodology (multiplication) may not be optimal for generating alpha. The hypothesis needs refinement in both signal construction and regime identification components.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors suffer from several issues: 1) Complex expressions with multiple nested functions increase overfitting risk, 2) Volume-weighted volatility calculations (return × volume) may introduce noise rather than signal, 3) The correlation/covariance between returns and volume changes may be too simplistic for order flow measurement. A simpler approach using rank-based volume momentum combined with price volatility relative to average volume could maintain the core hypothesis while reducing complexity. The poor financial metrics despite decent IC suggest the factors are capturing spurious relationships that don't translate to profitable strategies."

        "observations": "The current experiment results show mixed performance across the three factors implementing the noise regime hypothesis. While the IC metric slightly improved (0.006103 vs 0.005798), all three financial performance metrics deteriorated significantly compared to SOTA. The annualized return dropped from 0.052010 to -0.000073, information ratio from 0.972561 to -0.000920, and max drawdown worsened from -0.072585 to -0.125692. This suggests that while the factors may capture some predictive signal (as evidenced by the IC improvement), they fail to translate this into profitable trading strategies. The complexity of the factors is moderate, with expressions ranging from 150-250 characters, which may contribute to the poor generalization observed in financial metrics.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results partially refute the hypothesis that noise-driven market regimes amplify order flow imbalance signals. While the IC improvement suggests the factors capture some predictive relationship, the dramatic deterioration in financial performance metrics indicates that: 1) The noise regime filtering may not effectively identify profitable trading opportunities, 2) The order flow imbalance signals may be too noisy or poorly constructed, 3) The combination methodology (multiplication) may not be optimal for generating alpha. The hypothesis needs refinement in both signal construction and regime identification components.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors suffer from several issues: 1) Complex expressions with multiple nested functions increase overfitting risk, 2) Volume-weighted volatility calculations (return × volume) may introduce noise rather than signal, 3) The correlation/covariance between returns and volume changes may be too simplistic for order flow measurement. A simpler approach using rank-based volume momentum combined with price volatility relative to average volume could maintain the core hypothesis while reducing complexity. The poor financial metrics despite decent IC suggest the factors are capturing spurious relationships that don't translate to profitable strategies."

The IC (0.006491) shows a slight improvement over SOTA (0.005798), indicating better predictive correlation. However, risk-adjusted returns are significantly worse: information ratio (0.630943 vs 0.972561) and max drawdown (-0.105881 vs -0.072585) both deteriorated substantially. Annualized return (0.042950 vs 0.052010) also declined. The factors appear to be capturing some signal (improved IC) but with poor risk management characteristics.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis of identifying 'fundamental momentum traps' receives partial support. The improved IC suggests the factors are capturing some predictive signal related to momentum-quality divergence. However, the deterioration in risk-adjusted metrics indicates the implementation may be identifying traps that are either: 1) Too late (capturing stocks already in decline rather than predicting future declines), 2) Too noisy (including false positives that lead to poor risk characteristics), or 3) Missing important risk controls. The volatility-weighted approach in VWTI_{30D} appears to have backfired, potentially amplifying noise rather than improving signal quality during high-volatility periods.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show signs of over-engineering: 1) Multiple sign operations create unnecessary non-linearities, 2) Volatility weighting in denominator form may amplify noise, 3) The combination of multiple correlations and means creates complex interactions. The core insight - that deteriorating intraday price efficiency (high-low range normalized by volume) while prices are rising indicates weakness - should be tested in its simplest form. A simpler factor like: TS_CORR((high-low)/(volume+1e-8), sequence(20), 20) / (TS_MEAN(returns, 20) + 1e-8) would capture the divergence more directly. This reduces complexity while maintaining the core hypothesis that price momentum divided by deteriorating efficiency predicts negative returns."

The annualized return (0.071678 vs 0.052010) and IC (0.008592 vs 0.005798) outperform SOTA, indicating some predictive power for capturing mispricing signals. However, the max drawdown (-0.158859 vs -0.072585) and information ratio (0.833264 vs 0.972561) underperform SOTA, suggesting poor risk management and inconsistent alpha generation. The factors tested represent individual components of the hypothesized comprehensive system but lack the integrated, regime-adaptive structure described in the hypothesis.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results partially support the hypothesis but reveal critical gaps in implementation. The individual factors capture aspects of momentum, volume-return divergence, and price stability, but they operate independently rather than as an integrated system. The hypothesis proposes a sophisticated interaction between fundamental information diffusion lags, regime-dependent microstructure effects, and governance quality filters, but the tested factors lack: 1) Fundamental incorporation timing mechanisms, 2) Dynamic regime detection and adaptation, 3) Governance quality integration, and 4) Proper signal amplification during sentiment-driven reversal phases. The poor risk metrics (max drawdown) suggest the factors are not adequately adapting to market conditions.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show promise in annualized return and IC but suffer from poor risk metrics and potential complexity issues. The hypothesis needs to be simplified to focus on the most effective components while reducing overfitting risk. The new hypothesis should: 1) Combine momentum and volume signals in a simple, interpretable way, 2) Include volatility adjustment for better risk management, 3) Maintain expression length under 150 characters to avoid overfitting, 4) Use fewer base features (2-4 instead of current 5-6), and 5) Reduce free parameters. This approach addresses the complexity concerns while preserving the core idea of capturing systematic mispricing through price-volume relationships."

However, the max drawdown (-0.158859 vs -0.072585) and information ratio (0.833264 vs 0.972561) underperform SOTA, suggesting poor risk management and inconsistent alpha generation.

The individual factors capture aspects of momentum, volume-return divergence, and price stability, but they operate independently rather than as an integrated system. The hypothesis proposes a sophisticated interaction between fundamental information diffusion lags, regime-dependent microstructure effects, and governance quality filters, but the tested factors lack: 1) Fundamental incorporation timing mechanisms, 2) Dynamic regime detection and adaptation, 3) Governance quality integration, and 4) Proper signal amplification during sentiment-driven reversal phases. The poor risk metrics (max drawdown) suggest the factors are not adequately adapting to market conditions.",

        "reason": "The current factors show promise in annualized return and IC but suffer from poor risk metrics and potential complexity issues. The hypothesis needs to be simplified to focus on the most effective components while reducing overfitting risk. The new hypothesis should: 1) Combine momentum and volume signals in a simple, interpretable way, 2) Include volatility adjustment for better risk management, 3) Maintain expression length under 150 characters to avoid overfitting, 4) Use fewer base features (2-4 instead of current 5-6), and 5) Reduce free parameters. This approach addresses the complexity concerns while preserving the core idea of capturing systematic mispricing through price-volume relationships."

The annualized return (0.071678 vs 0.052010) and IC (0.008592 vs 0.005798) outperform SOTA, indicating some predictive power for capturing mispricing signals. However, the max drawdown (-0.158859 vs -0.072585) and information ratio (0.833264 vs 0.972561) underperform SOTA, suggesting poor risk management and inconsistent alpha generation. The factors tested represent individual components of the hypothesized comprehensive system but lack the integrated, regime-adaptive structure described in the hypothesis.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results partially support the hypothesis but reveal critical gaps in implementation. The individual factors capture aspects of momentum, volume-return divergence, and price stability, but they operate independently rather than as an integrated system. The hypothesis proposes a sophisticated interaction between fundamental information diffusion lags, regime-dependent microstructure effects, and governance quality filters, but the tested factors lack: 1) Fundamental incorporation timing mechanisms, 2) Dynamic regime detection and adaptation, 3) Governance quality integration, and 4) Proper signal amplification during sentiment-driven reversal phases. The poor risk metrics (max drawdown) suggest the factors are not adequately adapting to market conditions.",

        "reason": "The current factors show promise in annualized return and IC but suffer from poor risk metrics and potential complexity issues. The hypothesis needs to be simplified to focus on the most effective components while reducing overfitting risk. The new hypothesis should: 1) Combine momentum and volume signals in a simple, interpretable way, 2) Include volatility adjustment for better risk management, 3) Maintain expression length under 150 characters to avoid overfitting, 4) Use fewer base features (2-4 instead of current 5-6), and 5) Reduce free parameters. This approach addresses the complexity concerns while preserving the core idea of capturing systematic mispricing through price-volume relationships."

However, the poor portfolio performance indicates either: 1) The factor construction introduces noise or biases that hurt trading implementation, 2) The factors are capturing short-term noise rather than genuine behavioral patterns, or 3) The implementation has execution issues. The composite factor's particularly poor performance suggests combining multiple signals may be introducing overfitting rather than improving signal quality.",

The improved IC but poor portfolio metrics is classic overfitting behavior - the factor captures in-sample patterns but fails to generalize. A simpler approach using direct price change to volume change ratios with basic normalization would maintain the core hypothesis while reducing complexity. Specifically: 1) Replace z-scores with simple percentage changes, 2) Use a single window comparison rather than multiple timeframes, 3) Avoid multiplicative combination of multiple signals."

The results show mixed performance - while the IC (information coefficient) improved significantly over SOTA (0.007728 vs 0.005798), all three portfolio performance metrics (max drawdown, information ratio, and annualized return) deteriorated substantially. This suggests the factors have predictive power but translate poorly into portfolio returns, likely due to implementation issues or factor construction problems.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support but with important caveats. The improved IC suggests the core idea of identifying panic exhaustion through low-volume declines has merit for predicting returns. However, the poor portfolio performance indicates either: 1) The factor construction introduces noise or biases that hurt trading implementation, 2) The factors are capturing short-term noise rather than genuine behavioral patterns, or 3) The implementation has execution issues. The composite factor's particularly poor performance suggests combining multiple signals may be introducing overfitting rather than improving signal quality.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show concerning complexity patterns: 1) Volume_Disproportion_Factor_5D uses nested z-score transformations which may amplify noise, 2) Panic_Exhaustion_Composite_Factor combines multiple components multiplicatively, creating a highly nonlinear signal that likely overfits to training patterns. The improved IC but poor portfolio metrics is classic overfitting behavior - the factor captures in-sample patterns but fails to generalize. A simpler approach using direct price change to volume change ratios with basic normalization would maintain the core hypothesis while reducing complexity. Specifically: 1) Replace z-scores with simple percentage changes, 2) Use a single window comparison rather than multiple timeframes, 3) Avoid multiplicative combination of multiple signals."

This suggests the factors have predictive power but translate poorly into portfolio returns, likely due to implementation issues or factor construction problems.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support but with important caveats. The improved IC suggests the core idea of identifying panic exhaustion through low-volume declines has merit for predicting returns. However, the poor portfolio performance indicates either: 1) The factor construction introduces noise or biases that hurt trading implementation, 2) The factors are capturing short-term noise rather than genuine behavioral patterns, or 3) The implementation has execution issues. The composite factor's particularly poor performance suggests combining multiple signals may be introducing overfitting rather than improving signal quality.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show concerning complexity patterns: 1) Volume_Disproportion_Factor_5D uses nested z-score transformations which may amplify noise, 2) Panic_Exhaustion_Composite_Factor combines multiple components multiplicatively, creating a highly nonlinear signal that likely overfits to training patterns. The improved IC but poor portfolio metrics is classic overfitting behavior - the factor captures in-sample patterns but fails to generalize. A simpler approach using direct price change to volume change ratios with basic normalization would maintain the core hypothesis while reducing complexity. Specifically: 1) Replace z-scores with simple percentage changes, 2) Use a single window comparison rather than multiple timeframes, 3) Avoid multiplicative combination of multiple signals."

While the current result outperforms SOTA in annualized return (0.0710 vs 0.0520), information ratio (0.9821 vs 0.9726), and IC (0.0073 vs 0.0058), it significantly underperforms in max drawdown (-0.1031 vs -0.0726). This suggests the factors capture some predictive signals but with higher risk exposure. The factors demonstrate moderate complexity with symbol lengths ranging from 150-250 characters, using 3-5 base features each, which indicates potential overfitting concerns that need addressing.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results partially support the hypothesis that regime-adaptive structural inefficiency factors can capture temporary price dislocations. The improved IC and annualized return suggest the factors identify meaningful signals, but the worse max drawdown indicates insufficient risk control in the regime-switching mechanism. The hypothesis needs refinement in volatility management and regime transition smoothing. The cross-asset confirmation approach shows promise but requires better integration with the regime adaptation logic.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show predictive ability but suffer from complexity-induced overfitting and poor risk control. The new hypothesis focuses on: 1) Simplifying factor expressions to under 150 characters to reduce overfitting, 2) Using more robust regime detection through smoothed volatility ratios rather than binary switches, 3) Combining volume-price divergence with mean-reversion signals in a single unified framework, 4) Reducing the number of free parameters and base features to improve generalization. This approach maintains the core regime-adaptive concept while addressing the complexity and risk management issues observed in the current results."

While Max Drawdown is slightly worse (-7.82% vs -7.26%), the significant improvements in return and risk-adjusted metrics strongly support the hypothesis.

The combination of institutional volume confirmation, cross-asset spillover effects, and fundamental acceleration appears to create a robust multi-factor approach to identifying structural momentum. The improvement in IC suggests better alignment between predicted and actual returns, while the higher information ratio indicates superior risk-adjusted performance. The hypothesis successfully identifies that combining volume-price dynamics, sector-level trends, and fundamental momentum creates a more comprehensive signal than any single approach.",

        "reason": "While the current three-factor combination shows excellent performance, each individual factor has moderate complexity that could lead to overfitting. The next iteration should focus on simplification: 1) Combine the most effective elements into a single factor with fewer parameters, 2) Reduce expression length to under 150 characters, 3) Focus on 2-4 core features rather than multiple complex calculations. A simplified factor like: RANK(TS_CORR(volume_change, return, 20) * TS_MEAN(return, 10) / (TS_STD(return, 10) + ε)) would capture volume confirmation and risk-adjusted momentum in one expression. This maintains the hypothesis's core insight while dramatically reducing complexity."

While the information ratio (1.027926 vs 0.972561), annualized return (0.074768 vs 0.052010), and IC (0.008786 vs 0.005798) all show improvements over SOTA, the max drawdown has significantly worsened (-0.126319 vs -0.072585). This suggests that while the factors are capturing some predictive signal, they introduce higher volatility and larger downside risks. The three factors tested represent different aspects of the hypothesis: Fundamental_Behavioral_Deviation_20D_5D focuses on price deviation with reversal momentum, Volume_Stabilized_Reversion_10D incorporates volume stabilization, and Range_Volume_Divergence_15D captures price-volume divergence. However, none of these factors fully implement the complete multi-anchor framework described in the hypothesis, particularly missing fundamental anchors (book value, sector P/B), institutional ownership stability, retail trading intensity modulation, and market sentiment conditioning.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current results provide partial support for the hypothesis but highlight critical gaps. The improved IC and annualized return suggest that combining fundamental and behavioral signals has merit, but the significantly worse max drawdown indicates that the current implementations lack proper risk controls and may be capturing noise rather than genuine mean reversion signals. The hypothesis's core idea of regime-adaptive, multi-anchor mean reversion remains promising but requires more complete implementation. The current factors are too simplistic and miss key components: 1) No fundamental anchors (book value or sector P/B ratios), 2) No institutional ownership data, 3) No retail trading intensity measures, 4) No corporate event anticipation, 5) No market sentiment conditioning. These omissions likely contribute to the poor risk profile.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show promise but need simplification and more complete implementation. The complexity of the original hypothesis makes it difficult to implement with available data. The new hypothesis focuses on: 1) Using price deviation from moving average as a proxy for fundamental dislocation (since book value data isn't available), 2) Incorporating volume stabilization to identify behavioral signals, 3) Using shorter windows (5-10 days) to capture temporary dislocations while reducing noise, 4) Combining these signals multiplicatively to identify strong mean reversion candidates. This approach maintains the core multi-anchor concept while being implementable with available data and reducing complexity to avoid overfitting. The significantly worse max drawdown in current results suggests that longer windows (15-20 days) may be capturing noise rather than genuine mean reversion signals."

This suggests that while the factors are capturing some predictive signal, they introduce higher volatility and larger downside risks. The three factors tested represent different aspects of the hypothesis: Fundamental_Behavioral_Deviation_20D_5D focuses on price deviation with reversal momentum, Volume_Stabilized_Reversion_10D incorporates volume stabilization, and Range_Volume_Divergence_15D captures price-volume divergence. However, none of these factors fully implement the complete multi-anchor framework described in the hypothesis, particularly missing fundamental anchors (book value, sector P/B), institutional ownership stability, retail trading intensity modulation, and market sentiment conditioning.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current results provide partial support for the hypothesis but highlight critical gaps. The improved IC and annualized return suggest that combining fundamental and behavioral signals has merit, but the significantly worse max drawdown indicates that the current implementations lack proper risk controls and may be capturing noise rather than genuine mean reversion signals. The hypothesis's core idea of regime-adaptive, multi-anchor mean reversion remains promising but requires more complete implementation. The current factors are too simplistic and miss key components: 1) No fundamental anchors (book value or sector P/B ratios), 2) No institutional ownership data, 3) No retail trading intensity measures, 4) No corporate event anticipation, 5) No market sentiment conditioning. These omissions likely contribute to the poor risk profile.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show promise but need simplification and more complete implementation. The complexity of the original hypothesis makes it difficult to implement with available data. The new hypothesis focuses on: 1) Using price deviation from moving average as a proxy for fundamental dislocation (since book value data isn't available), 2) Incorporating volume stabilization to identify behavioral signals, 3) Using shorter windows (5-10 days) to capture temporary dislocations while reducing noise, 4) Combining these signals multiplicatively to identify strong mean reversion candidates. This approach maintains the core multi-anchor concept while being implementable with available data and reducing complexity to avoid overfitting. The significantly worse max drawdown in current results suggests that longer windows (15-20 days) may be capturing noise rather than genuine mean reversion signals."

This suggests that while the factors are capturing some predictive signal, they introduce higher volatility and larger downside risks. The three factors tested represent different aspects of the hypothesis: Fundamental_Behavioral_Deviation_20D_5D focuses on price deviation with reversal momentum, Volume_Stabilized_Reversion_10D incorporates volume stabilization, and Range_Volume_Divergence_15D captures price-volume divergence. However, none of these factors fully implement the complete multi-anchor framework described in the hypothesis, particularly missing fundamental anchors (book value, sector P/B), institutional ownership stability, retail trading intensity modulation, and market sentiment conditioning.",

The hypothesis's core idea of regime-adaptive, multi-anchor mean reversion remains promising but requires more complete implementation. The current factors are too simplistic and miss key components: 1) No fundamental anchors (book value or sector P/B ratios), 2) No institutional ownership data, 3) No retail trading intensity measures, 4) No corporate event anticipation, 5) No market sentiment conditioning. These omissions likely contribute to the poor risk profile.",

The complexity of the original hypothesis makes it difficult to implement with available data. The new hypothesis focuses on: 1) Using price deviation from moving average as a proxy for fundamental dislocation (since book value data isn't available), 2) Incorporating volume stabilization to identify behavioral signals, 3) Using shorter windows (5-10 days) to capture temporary dislocations while reducing noise, 4) Combining these signals multiplicatively to identify strong mean reversion candidates. This approach maintains the core multi-anchor concept while being implementable with available data and reducing complexity to avoid overfitting. The significantly worse max drawdown in current results suggests that longer windows (15-20 days) may be capturing noise rather than genuine mean reversion signals."

However, the information ratio (0.827 vs 0.973) and max drawdown (-8.47% vs -7.26%) are worse, suggesting higher risk-adjusted performance issues. The factors demonstrate moderate success in capturing the hypothesis elements but reveal implementation challenges.",

The improved annualized return suggests the multi-factor approach has merit. However, the deterioration in risk-adjusted metrics indicates the current factor construction may not adequately capture the 'dynamic scaling based on volatility regimes and news event timing' aspect of the hypothesis. The factors are static implementations without the adaptive components mentioned in the hypothesis.",

        "reason": "The current factors show promise but need simplification to avoid overfitting. The Institutional_Order_Flow_Imbalance_15D (IOFI) factor has reasonable complexity but could be more robust. The Retail_Sentiment_Divergence_10D (RSD) factor uses SIGN function which creates discrete outputs that may not capture sentiment gradients effectively. The Fundamental_Instability_Volatility_20D (FIV) factor is overly complex with nested z-score and ranking operations. A simpler composite that captures the core relationships with fewer operations and parameters would likely generalize better. The volatility regime adaptation should be implemented through dynamic weighting rather than separate factors."

While the information ratio, annualized return, and IC show slight improvements, the maximum drawdown has worsened significantly (-0.089 vs -0.073). This suggests the current implementation captures some alpha but at the cost of increased risk during market downturns. The factors are relatively simple (symbol lengths under 150 characters, using only return and volume features), which reduces overfitting risk but may not fully capture the hypothesis's complexity.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results provide partial support for the hypothesis but reveal implementation gaps. The Resilience_Score_20D and Tactical_Reversal_Signal_10D factors show predictive power (positive IC), indicating that price stability and volume-price divergence signals work. However, the worsened drawdown suggests the 'dual-layer alpha' protection isn't fully realized. The Volatility_Regime_Indicator_15D may not be effectively triggering the strategy during high-stress periods. Key missing components from the hypothesis include: 1) No supply chain stability or governance transparency proxies, 2) No institutional ownership data, 3) No retail sentiment or spread indicators, 4) No fundamental momentum measures. The current implementation tests only simplified technical aspects.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current implementation shows promise but needs refinement. Instead of adding complex missing components (which would increase overfitting risk), we should optimize what works: 1) The positive IC suggests the divergence signal has merit, 2) The poor drawdown indicates need for better risk management, 3) Simpler, robust factors tend to generalize better. The new hypothesis maintains the core divergence concept but adds explicit risk controls. We should test: 1) Different parameter combinations for the existing factors, 2) Alternative volume trend calculations, 3) Position sizing based on stability scores to reduce drawdown, 4) More sophisticated volatility regime detection."

The new hypothesis focuses on simplification: using fewer features (primarily price and volume), shorter lookback periods, and clearer mean-reversion signals.

The combined result shows mixed performance compared to SOTA. The annualized return (0.054323) slightly exceeds SOTA (0.052010), indicating some improvement in raw return generation. However, the information ratio (0.780287 vs 0.972561) and IC (0.005542 vs 0.005798) are both lower than SOTA, suggesting weaker risk-adjusted returns and predictive correlation. The max drawdown (-0.088091 vs -0.072585) is also worse, indicating higher downside risk. The factors appear to capture some alpha but with increased volatility and reduced consistency.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results provide partial support for the hypothesis. The improved annualized return suggests that the factors are capturing some mispricing opportunities related to institutional flows and rebalancing events. However, the deterioration in information ratio and IC indicates that the signals are noisy and may not consistently predict returns. The hypothesis about price distortions around index reconstitution and ETF rebalancing appears valid but needs refinement in implementation. The current factor constructions may be capturing temporary price movements but with insufficient filtering of noise or proper timing of reversals.",

        "reason": "The current factors show promise but suffer from complexity and noise. The ETF_Rebalance_Flow_Reversal_20D factor has a symbol length of approximately 120 characters and uses 4 base features (close, volume, return, TS functions), which is moderate but could be simplified. The Index_Reconstitution_Reversion_25D factor has similar complexity. The Passive_Ownership_Price_Pressure_15D factor uses correlation calculations that may introduce noise. The new hypothesis focuses on simplification: using fewer features (primarily price and volume), shorter lookback periods, and clearer mean-reversion signals. Instead of combining multiple complex components (ranking, z-scores, correlations, momentum signs), a simpler approach might yield more robust signals. For example: RANK((close - TS_MEAN(close, 10)) * volume / TS_MEAN(volume, 20)). This captures price deviation amplified by relative volume, with ranking for cross-sectional comparison. The simplification should reduce overfitting risk while maintaining the core idea of flow-induced price distortions."

While the information ratio (1.401 vs 0.973), annualized return (0.090 vs 0.052), and IC (0.0075 vs 0.0058) all show significant improvements over SOTA, the max drawdown slightly worsened (-0.074 vs -0.073). This suggests that the individual components capture some predictive power but lack the integration and regime adaptation described in the full hypothesis. The factors are relatively simple (symbol lengths: ~80, ~50, ~120 characters respectively) with reasonable feature counts (2-3 features each), indicating they are not overfitting despite their simplicity.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results partially support the hypothesis that multiple anchors can improve mean reversion signals, but reveal critical gaps: 1) The components are tested individually rather than integrated, missing the synergistic effects described in the hypothesis. 2) No fundamental anchors (book value, sector P/B) were implemented, which was a core part of the hypothesis. 3) No regime adaptation mechanism was included. 4) The volume stabilization factor (VSR_10D) shows promise but needs refinement - its current formulation multiplies volume volatility with price deviation, which may not optimally capture the 'sentiment exhaustion with volume stabilization' concept.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current results show that even simplified components can outperform SOTA, suggesting the core idea has merit. However, the hypothesis needs simplification to avoid over-engineering. The new hypothesis focuses on the two most promising anchors from the original: 1) price deviation from historical mean (capturing mean reversion tendency) and 2) volume stabilization (capturing sentiment exhaustion). By combining these in a simple multiplicative or additive framework, we can test whether their interaction provides better signals than either alone. This approach reduces complexity while maintaining the multi-anchor concept. The formulation should be kept under 150 characters to ensure robustness."

This suggests the regime-adaptive reversal factors are generating higher returns but with increased downside risk. The IC improvement indicates better predictive correlation, but the drawdown deterioration raises concerns about risk management effectiveness.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results partially support the hypothesis that regime-adaptive structural reversal factors can enhance robustness across market conditions. The improved information ratio and annualized return suggest the volatility weighting and volume confirmation components are adding value. However, the worsened max drawdown indicates that the current implementation may not be adequately controlling downside risk during adverse market regimes. The hypothesis about identifying temporary price dislocations appears valid given the IC improvement, but the 'dynamic adjustment based on volatility regimes' aspect needs refinement to better protect against drawdowns.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show promise but have concerning complexity indicators that may lead to overfitting. The symbol lengths range from 150-250 characters, and they use multiple nested functions (TS_CORR, DELTA, SIGN, RANK combinations). While metrics show improvement in some areas, the drawdown deterioration suggests the factors may be capturing noise rather than true structural inefficiencies. A simpler formulation with fewer free parameters and shorter expression length (<150 characters) would reduce overfitting risk while maintaining the core adaptive reversal logic. The focus should shift from trying to capture every aspect of the hypothesis to implementing the most robust components effectively."

The IC improvement indicates better predictive correlation, but the drawdown deterioration raises concerns about risk management effectiveness.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results partially support the hypothesis that regime-adaptive structural reversal factors can enhance robustness across market conditions. The improved information ratio and annualized return suggest the volatility weighting and volume confirmation components are adding value. However, the worsened max drawdown indicates that the current implementation may not be adequately controlling downside risk during adverse market regimes. The hypothesis about identifying temporary price dislocations appears valid given the IC improvement, but the 'dynamic adjustment based on volatility regimes' aspect needs refinement to better protect against drawdowns.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show promise but have concerning complexity indicators that may lead to overfitting. The symbol lengths range from 150-250 characters, and they use multiple nested functions (TS_CORR, DELTA, SIGN, RANK combinations). While metrics show improvement in some areas, the drawdown deterioration suggests the factors may be capturing noise rather than true structural inefficiencies. A simpler formulation with fewer free parameters and shorter expression length (<150 characters) would reduce overfitting risk while maintaining the core adaptive reversal logic. The focus should shift from trying to capture every aspect of the hypothesis to implementing the most robust components effectively."

However, the increased drawdown and reduced information ratio indicate the factors may be capturing noise or introducing volatility.

The volume stability and flow imbalance concepts show promise, but the implementation may be too complex or sensitive to market conditions.",

Each factor uses multiple features ($volume, $close, $high, $low), multiple time windows (5D, 15D, 20D, 30D), and complex transformations (RANK, SIGN, TS_CORR, DELTA). This creates high symbol length and many free parameters. The next iteration should focus on: 1) Drastically simplifying expressions to under 150 characters, 2) Reducing base features to 2-3 core ones, 3) Using fewer time windows, 4) Eliminating unnecessary transformations. A simpler factor like: RANK(TS_MEAN(volume, 10) / (TS_STD(close, 10) + 1e-8)) would test if the core volume-volatility relationship alone provides signal without overfitting risk."

This suggests the factor captures some predictive signal but with higher volatility and worse risk management.

The factor's positive IC and annualized return suggest that volume-pressure reversal signals have predictive value, aligning with the hypothesis that institutional liquidity demands create temporary mispricing. However, the poor risk-adjusted metrics (especially drawdown) indicate the signal may be noisy or prone to false positives, suggesting the factor construction needs refinement to better isolate genuine institutional rebalancing effects from general volume noise.",

Target a symbol length under 100 characters with 2-3 base features. For example: SIGN(return) × TS_ZSCORE(volume, 20) × (volume - TS_MEAN(volume, 10))/TS_STD(volume, 20)."

While it achieves higher annualized return (0.061609 vs 0.052010) and slightly better IC (0.005848 vs 0.005798), it underperforms on risk-adjusted metrics: worse max drawdown (-0.093529 vs -0.072585) and lower information ratio (0.948835 vs 0.972561). This suggests the factor captures some alpha but with higher volatility and worse downside protection.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support. The combination of behavioral reversal (SentFundDivergence), institutional accumulation (StressAccumulation), and liquidity filtering (LiquidityFilteredReversal) does generate positive annualized returns and IC, indicating the core idea has merit. However, the deterioration in drawdown and information ratio suggests the factor construction may be amplifying volatility or failing to adequately filter false positives during stress periods. The institutional accumulation component (StressAccumulation) might not be effectively identifying 'smart money' positioning as hypothesized.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factor combination shows promise in generating returns but suffers from risk management issues. The StressAccumulation component (correlation between price range and volume normalized by volatility) may be introducing unnecessary complexity and noise. A simpler approach focusing on: 1) momentum-volatility divergence as the core reversal signal, and 2) a more direct liquidity measure using volume-adjusted bid-ask spread proxy (e.g., (high-low)/volume) could maintain the alpha while reducing volatility. This addresses the complexity concern while preserving the behavioral overreaction and liquidity constraint concepts."

While it achieves higher annualized return (0.061609 vs 0.052010) and slightly better IC (0.005848 vs 0.005798), it underperforms on risk-adjusted metrics: worse max drawdown (-0.093529 vs -0.072585) and lower information ratio (0.948835 vs 0.972561). This suggests the factor captures some alpha but with higher volatility and worse downside protection.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support. The combination of behavioral reversal (SentFundDivergence), institutional accumulation (StressAccumulation), and liquidity filtering (LiquidityFilteredReversal) does generate positive annualized returns and IC, indicating the core idea has merit. However, the deterioration in drawdown and information ratio suggests the factor construction may be amplifying volatility or failing to adequately filter false positives during stress periods. The institutional accumulation component (StressAccumulation) might not be effectively identifying 'smart money' positioning as hypothesized.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factor combination shows promise in generating returns but suffers from risk management issues. The StressAccumulation component (correlation between price range and volume normalized by volatility) may be introducing unnecessary complexity and noise. A simpler approach focusing on: 1) momentum-volatility divergence as the core reversal signal, and 2) a more direct liquidity measure using volume-adjusted bid-ask spread proxy (e.g., (high-low)/volume) could maintain the alpha while reducing volatility. This addresses the complexity concern while preserving the behavioral overreaction and liquidity constraint concepts."

The current experiment tested two implemented factors (CrossSectional_Governance_Momentum_20D and SentimentDriven_Reversal_Detection_15D) that represent only partial components of the original hypothesis. The annualized return (0.073514 vs 0.052010) and information ratio (1.079764 vs 0.972561) show improvement over SOTA, while IC (0.006659 vs 0.005798) shows slight improvement. However, max drawdown worsened (-0.094340 vs -0.072585), indicating increased risk. The most critical observation is that both implemented factors are complex implementations that likely suffer from overfitting - they use multiple nested functions, long expressions, and attempt to capture sophisticated concepts with limited base features. The original hypothesis was too ambitious given the available toolkit, leading to fragmented implementations that don't fully test the core regime-adaptive momentum concept.",

Neither captures the core 'regime-adaptive' switching mechanism, institutional accumulation patterns, or cross-asset spillovers mentioned in the hypothesis.

        "observations": "The combined results show mixed performance with some improvements over SOTA but significant concerns about factor complexity and implementation limitations. The current experiment tested two implemented factors (CrossSectional_Governance_Momentum_20D and SentimentDriven_Reversal_Detection_15D) that represent only partial components of the original hypothesis. The annualized return (0.073514 vs 0.052010) and information ratio (1.079764 vs 0.972561) show improvement over SOTA, while IC (0.006659 vs 0.005798) shows slight improvement. However, max drawdown worsened (-0.094340 vs -0.072585), indicating increased risk. The most critical observation is that both implemented factors are complex implementations that likely suffer from overfitting - they use multiple nested functions, long expressions, and attempt to capture sophisticated concepts with limited base features. The original hypothesis was too ambitious given the available toolkit, leading to fragmented implementations that don't fully test the core regime-adaptive momentum concept.",

While some metrics improved, this likely comes from overfitting rather than genuine regime-adaptive momentum capture.

Neither captures the core 'regime-adaptive' switching mechanism, institutional accumulation patterns, or cross-asset spillovers mentioned in the hypothesis. The improvement in annualized return and information ratio suggests that volatility-adjusted momentum signals have value, but the worsening drawdown indicates poor risk management. The hypothesis needs to be significantly simplified and focused on implementable components with the available toolkit.",

The new hypothesis focuses on what can actually be implemented: price, volume, and basic statistical functions. 3. Core Concept Preservation: While simplifying, we retain the core idea of combining momentum with confirmation signals. 4. Risk Management: The worsened drawdown suggests need for better volatility management. 5. Test Performance Concern: Complex factors often fail on out-of-sample data despite good training metrics.

This indicates that the cross-asset momentum spillover hypothesis has strong predictive power when implemented through these three complementary factors. The factors appear to capture different aspects of information diffusion: CrossAsset_Momentum_Spillover_5D measures delayed autocorrelation, Institutional_Lag_Volatility_Adjustment captures institutional processing delays, and Segmented_Market_Momentum_Diffusion identifies intraday vs. close-to-close momentum divergences.",

The combination of three different implementations of this theoretical framework shows synergistic effects, with each factor capturing distinct aspects of the information diffusion process. The significant improvement in annualized return and information ratio suggests that institutional information processing lags and market segmentation effects are exploitable market inefficiencies. However, the factor Segmented_Momentum_Momentum_Diffusion has concerning complexity with multiple nested functions and delays, which could lead to overfitting despite current strong performance.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "While the current factors perform well, the complexity of Segmented_Market_Momentum_Diffusion (with nested TS_MEAN, DELAY, and SIGN functions) creates overfitting risk. The core hypothesis remains valid, but implementation should be simplified: 1) Focus on the most robust signal - delayed return autocorrelation; 2) Reduce parameter count and function nesting; 3) Use simpler normalization schemes. Next iteration should test: 1) Basic 5-day return autocorrelation without ranking; 2) Volatility persistence ratio with fixed denominator; 3) Simple intraday range vs. return divergence without multiple delays. This maintains the theoretical framework while addressing complexity concerns."

While the factors show some promise, they fail to fully capture the hypothesized transient liquidity dislocations caused by algorithmic trading patterns. The results show mixed performance: the IC (0.006721) is slightly better than SOTA (0.005798), indicating improved predictive correlation, but all three risk-adjusted return metrics (max drawdown, information ratio, annualized return) are worse than SOTA. This suggests the factors have some signal quality but poor portfolio implementation characteristics. The factors appear to be over-engineered approximations of high-frequency concepts using only daily data, lacking the temporal granularity needed to capture true microstructure effects.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis about transient liquidity dislocations from algorithmic trading patterns is NOT supported by these results. The implemented factors are daily proxies that miss the intraday dynamics crucial for microstructure analysis. The poor risk-adjusted returns despite decent IC suggest the factors capture some noise or spurious patterns rather than genuine predictive signals. The factors measure different aspects (price-range correlation, return-volume divergence, autocorrelation of price impact) but none directly address algorithmic trading pressure or transient liquidity imbalances. The gap between hypothesis and implementation is too large - daily data cannot adequately proxy for high-frequency algorithmic patterns.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors are too complex (long expressions with multiple nested functions) and attempt to approximate high-frequency concepts with daily data. The slight IC improvement suggests there might be value in price-volume relationships, but the implementation needs simplification. The new hypothesis focuses on a more achievable goal: identifying mean-reversion opportunities from abnormal price-volume patterns using only daily data. This aligns better with available data while maintaining the core idea of temporary imbalances. The simpler approach should reduce overfitting risk while potentially improving risk-adjusted returns."

While the factors show some promise, they fail to fully capture the hypothesized transient liquidity dislocations caused by algorithmic trading patterns. The results show mixed performance: the IC (0.006721) is slightly better than SOTA (0.005798), indicating improved predictive correlation, but all three risk-adjusted return metrics (max drawdown, information ratio, annualized return) are worse than SOTA.

The implemented factors are daily proxies that miss the intraday dynamics crucial for microstructure analysis. The poor risk-adjusted returns despite decent IC suggest the factors capture some noise or spurious patterns rather than genuine predictive signals. The factors measure different aspects (price-range correlation, return-volume divergence, autocorrelation of price impact) but none directly address algorithmic trading pressure or transient liquidity imbalances. The gap between hypothesis and implementation is too large - daily data cannot adequately proxy for high-frequency algorithmic patterns.",

The new hypothesis focuses on a more achievable goal: identifying mean-reversion opportunities from abnormal price-volume patterns using only daily data. This aligns better with available data while maintaining the core idea of temporary imbalances. The simpler approach should reduce overfitting risk while potentially improving risk-adjusted returns."

The current implementation achieves a slightly better IC (0.006544 vs 0.005798) than SOTA, indicating better predictive correlation. However, all three risk-adjusted return metrics (max drawdown, information ratio, annualized return) are worse than SOTA. The annualized return of 0.045165 is significantly lower than SOTA's 0.052010, representing a 13.2% reduction. This suggests that while the factors capture some predictive signal, they fail to translate this into superior portfolio performance.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results partially support the hypothesis but reveal critical implementation gaps. The positive IC improvement suggests that the core idea of identifying institutional accumulation patterns has merit. However, the poor risk-adjusted returns indicate that the current simplified proxies (volume-return correlation, volatility-volume correlation, high-volume day counting) are insufficient to capture the sophisticated institutional flow dynamics described in the hypothesis. Specifically missing are: 1) True institutional flow data (large-ticket transactions), 2) Options market positioning data, 3) Market regime conditioning for uncertainty periods, and 4) Multi-timeframe momentum persistence analysis. The factors are too simplistic representations of complex institutional behavior.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current implementation needs simplification and focus. The three tested factors have moderate complexity (symbol lengths around 100-150 characters) but lack integration and regime conditioning. The new hypothesis proposes: 1) Focus on volume-price divergence as a cleaner proxy for institutional flow, 2) Explicit volatility regime conditioning to capture market uncertainty periods, 3) Simplified two-stage approach (accumulation detection + momentum persistence) rather than multiple disjoint signals. This maintains the core institutional accumulation concept while reducing overfitting risk through simpler construction and explicit regime logic. Target factor complexity: <120 characters, using 3-4 base features."

While the IC (0.006717) shows improvement over SOTA (0.005798), the portfolio performance metrics (information ratio, annualized return, and max drawdown) are significantly worse than SOTA. This suggests the current factors are capturing some predictive signal but failing to translate it into profitable portfolio construction. The complexity of the factors, particularly Conditional_Resonance_Deviation_5D with its conditional logic and percentile threshold, is likely causing overfitting and poor out-of-sample performance despite the improved IC.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support. The improved IC suggests that combining price-volume resonance with price deviation does capture some predictive information about future returns. However, the dramatic deterioration in portfolio metrics strongly refutes the notion that this predictive power is strongest when RESI5 is high or that it leads to profitable trading strategies in the current implementation. The conditional filtering approach appears to be detrimental to portfolio construction.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors are over-engineered. The high symbol lengths, use of regression residuals (REGRESI), sequence generation, conditional operators, and cross-sectional percentiles introduce excessive complexity. This complexity is the primary cause of the discrepancy between improved IC and poor portfolio performance – a classic sign of overfitting. The new hypothesis strips away these complexities to focus on the fundamental idea: price-volume coordination combined with recent price trend. A simpler factor like `RANK(WMA(close, 5) * TS_CORR(close, volume, 5))` (which is essentially the first factor tested) should be re-evaluated as a baseline, or further simplified by using a simple moving average instead of weighted. The goal is to achieve a factor with a symbol length well under 150 characters, using only 2-3 base features ($close, $volume), and minimal free parameters to ensure better generalization to the test set."

This suggests the hypothesis has some merit but current implementations are not optimal. The annualized return improvement indicates the core idea of combining trend stability with microstructure pressure has predictive value, but the factor constructions may be capturing noise or overfitting to specific patterns.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis that 'interaction between medium-term trend stability and short-term microstructure pressure predicts near-term price reversals' receives partial support. The improved annualized return suggests the directional insight is correct - stocks with high trend stability but elevated short-term pressure do exhibit subsequent negative returns. However, the underperformance in information ratio and IC indicates the current mathematical formulations may not efficiently capture this relationship or may introduce unnecessary complexity that reduces signal quality. The hypothesis should be refined to focus on more robust, simpler implementations of the same core concept.",

Trend_Stability_Pressure_Factor_10_5 (TSP_{10,5} = R^2_{10D} × (high-low)/ATR_{5D}) is the simplest and likely most robust, yet still underperforms SOTA in most metrics. The other two factors introduce additional complexity (z-scores, ranking, median calculations) without clear benefit. The complexity feedback from previous iterations indicates that simpler factors with fewer parameters and shorter expressions tend to generalize better. The new hypothesis focuses on extracting the core signal with minimal transformation: stable trends (measured by R-squared) combined with elevated intraday volatility (measured simply by daily range or range relative to recent average)."

This suggests the hypothesis has some merit but current implementations are not optimal. The annualized return improvement indicates the core idea of combining trend stability with microstructure pressure has predictive value, but the factor constructions may be capturing noise or overfitting to specific patterns.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis that 'interaction between medium-term trend stability and short-term microstructure pressure predicts near-term price reversals' receives partial support. The improved annualized return suggests the directional insight is correct - stocks with high trend stability but elevated short-term pressure do exhibit subsequent negative returns. However, the underperformance in information ratio and IC indicates the current mathematical formulations may not efficiently capture this relationship or may introduce unnecessary complexity that reduces signal quality. The hypothesis should be refined to focus on more robust, simpler implementations of the same core concept.",

Trend_Stability_Pressure_Factor_10_5 (TSP_{10,5} = R^2_{10D} × (high-low)/ATR_{5D}) is the simplest and likely most robust, yet still underperforms SOTA in most metrics. The other two factors introduce additional complexity (z-scores, ranking, median calculations) without clear benefit. The complexity feedback from previous iterations indicates that simpler factors with fewer parameters and shorter expressions tend to generalize better. The new hypothesis focuses on extracting the core signal with minimal transformation: stable trends (measured by R-squared) combined with elevated intraday volatility (measured simply by daily range or range relative to recent average)."

This suggests the hypothesis has some merit but current implementations are not optimal. The annualized return improvement indicates the core idea of combining trend stability with microstructure pressure has predictive value, but the factor constructions may be capturing noise or overfitting to specific patterns.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis that 'interaction between medium-term trend stability and short-term microstructure pressure predicts near-term price reversals' receives partial support. The improved annualized return suggests the directional insight is correct - stocks with high trend stability but elevated short-term pressure do exhibit subsequent negative returns. However, the underperformance in information ratio and IC indicates the current mathematical formulations may not efficiently capture this relationship or may introduce unnecessary complexity that reduces signal quality. The hypothesis should be refined to focus on more robust, simpler implementations of the same core concept.",

        "reason": "The current factors show promising annualized returns but poor risk-adjusted metrics, suggesting overfitting or inefficient signal construction. Trend_Stability_Pressure_Factor_10_5 (TSP_{10,5} = R^2_{10D} × (high-low)/ATR_{5D}) is the simplest and likely most robust, yet still underperforms SOTA in most metrics. The other two factors introduce additional complexity (z-scores, ranking, median calculations) without clear benefit. The complexity feedback from previous iterations indicates that simpler factors with fewer parameters and shorter expressions tend to generalize better. The new hypothesis focuses on extracting the core signal with minimal transformation: stable trends (measured by R-squared) combined with elevated intraday volatility (measured simply by daily range or range relative to recent average)."

The tested factors focus on basic momentum calculations with simple volume or liquidity adjustments, missing key elements like institutional flow acceleration, short interest dynamics, and cross-asset confirmation signals. The poor financial performance suggests these factors either overfit to noise or lack the necessary robustness filters to translate predictive correlation into profitable signals. The multi-timeframe approach shows potential but needs more sophisticated implementation.",

        "hypothesis": "Hypothesis: A regime-aware, multi-dimensional mean reversion factor that identifies temporary price dislocations driven by fundamental information diffusion lags, behavioral biases, and supply-demand imbalances, where the strength and timing of reversion are dynamically calibrated by fundamental quality signals and volume-based confirmation.\n                Concise Observation: Parent strategies show complementary strengths: one exploits cross-sectional fundamental diffusion lags (RankIC=0.027), while another uses multi-anchor mean reversion with regime adaptation (RankIC=0.025), suggesting fusion could capture both fundamental mispricing and technical dislocation simultaneously.\n                Concise Justification: The fusion combines fundamental information timing with behavioral dislocation detection, creating a more robust signal by requiring dual confirmation from both fundamental quality metrics and price-based anchors, reducing false positives while maintaining directional bias.\n                Concise Knowledge: If fundamental information diffuses slowly while behavioral reactions occur quickly, creating temporary mispricing; when supply-demand imbalances interact with both fundamental and behavioral drivers, mean reversion signals can be enhanced through multi-anchor confirmation and regime adaptation.\n                concise Specification: The factor should: 1) use fundamental quality metrics (e.g., ROE, earnings quality) to identify information diffusion lags; 2) employ multiple anchors (book value, sector P/B, historical price levels) to define reversion targets; 3) incorporate volume acceleration and stabilization patterns for timing confirmation; 4) dynamically scale reversion strength based on fundamental quality; 5) require both fundamental and technical signals to trigger.\n                ",

        "observations": "The combined results show mixed performance with some metrics outperforming SOTA while others underperform. The annualized return (0.078426 vs 0.052010) and information ratio (1.008686 vs 0.972561) show significant improvements over SOTA, suggesting the regime-aware approach has merit. However, the max drawdown is worse (-0.089527 vs -0.072585), indicating higher risk or potential overfitting. The IC (0.008508 vs 0.005798) shows slight improvement but remains low, suggesting weak predictive power. All three factors exhibit concerning complexity with long expressions (>250 characters), multiple nested functions, and numerous base features, making them highly susceptible to overfitting despite decent training metrics.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support - the regime-aware approach shows promise in improving returns and information ratios, but the increased drawdown and complexity issues suggest the current implementations may be over-engineered. The multi-dimensional aspect (combining price dislocation, fundamental quality, and volume confirmation) appears to add value, but the specific mathematical formulations need simplification to improve robustness. The fundamental quality anchor concept shows potential, but using price volatility as a proxy for fundamental quality may be insufficient.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show promise but suffer from excessive complexity (all have symbol length >250, multiple base features, and complex conditional branches). This complexity likely causes the poor max drawdown despite good returns. A simpler factor with: 1) Price dislocation from median (10-15 day window), 2) Single regime indicator (volume change or volatility regime, not both), 3) Simple scaling rather than complex conditional multiplication, 4) Reduced parameter count and base features (<4). This approach should maintain the regime-aware concept while reducing overfitting risk. The next iteration should test whether the core mean reversion signal with one regime indicator can achieve similar or better performance with lower complexity."

While the information ratio (1.239 vs 0.973), annualized return (0.076 vs 0.052), and IC (0.0065 vs 0.0058) all improved significantly, the max drawdown worsened (-0.076 vs -0.073). This suggests the factors capture some predictive signal but may increase risk exposure. The hypothesis's core concept of multi-dimensional divergence was only partially tested, as the Sentiment_Fundamental_Divergence_20D factor was not implemented.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The partial implementation provides limited support for the hypothesis. The improved information ratio and annualized return suggest that combining institutional-fundamental mismatch with volatility-scaling adds value, but the worse drawdown indicates increased risk. The hypothesis's emphasis on 'multi-dimensional confirmation' was not fully tested since only two dimensions were implemented. The Volatility_Scaled_Reversal_10D factor deviated from the original hypothesis by focusing on volatility-scaling rather than detecting mispricing during volatility regimes. Future iterations should implement the complete multi-dimensional framework to properly test the hypothesis.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current results show promise but need refinement: 1) The improved IC and returns suggest divergence signals work, but the drawdown increase indicates risk management issues. 2) The hypothesis was only partially tested - we need the sentiment-fundamental component. 3) Both implemented factors are relatively simple (character counts: IFM_15D ~180 chars, VSR_10D ~120 chars), which is good for avoiding overfitting. 4) The volatility factor should be modified to better align with the hypothesis's 'mispricing during volatility regimes' concept. 5) Future iterations should focus on: a) Implementing the missing sentiment-fundamental factor, b) Creating a combined signal from all three dimensions, c) Ensuring each factor remains simple (<150 chars), d) Adding risk controls to improve drawdown."

        "hypothesis": "Hypothesis: Stocks exhibit predictable price reversals when sentiment-driven momentum diverges from fundamental quality and this divergence coincides with institutional ownership rebalancing that contradicts fundamental momentum, particularly during elevated volatility regimes where mispricing becomes most pronounced, creating a multi-dimensional confirmation signal for mean reversion.\n                Concise Observation: Parent strategies show moderate predictive power (RankIC ~0.023-0.022) using behavioral and institutional divergence separately, suggesting combining these layers with volatility filtering could enhance signal robustness and reduce false positives.\n                Concise Justification: Combining retail sentiment decay with institutional positioning mismatches creates a multi-agent confirmation system, while volatility scaling adapts to regimes where mean reversion tendencies are strongest, theoretically improving signal-to-noise ratio.\n                Concise Knowledge: If sentiment-driven price momentum diverges from fundamental quality while institutional ownership rebalancing contradicts fundamental momentum, and volatility is elevated, then mispricing is likely most extreme and prone to correction, providing a high-conviction mean reversion signal.\n                concise Specification: The factor should measure: 1) divergence between sentiment-driven momentum and fundamental quality, 2) divergence between institutional ownership momentum and fundamental momentum, 3) market volatility level; signals are strongest when all three conditions align, with position sizing scaled by volatility.\n                ",

        "observations": "The current experiment tested two factors from the multi-dimensional hypothesis: Institutional_Fundamental_Mismatch_15D and Volatility_Scaled_Reversal_10D. The results show mixed performance compared to SOTA. While the information ratio (1.239 vs 0.973), annualized return (0.076 vs 0.052), and IC (0.0065 vs 0.0058) all improved significantly, the max drawdown worsened (-0.076 vs -0.073). This suggests the factors capture some predictive signal but may increase risk exposure. The hypothesis's core concept of multi-dimensional divergence was only partially tested, as the Sentiment_Fundamental_Divergence_20D factor was not implemented.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The partial implementation provides limited support for the hypothesis. The improved information ratio and annualized return suggest that combining institutional-fundamental mismatch with volatility-scaling adds value, but the worse drawdown indicates increased risk. The hypothesis's emphasis on 'multi-dimensional confirmation' was not fully tested since only two dimensions were implemented. The Volatility_Scaled_Reversal_10D factor deviated from the original hypothesis by focusing on volatility-scaling rather than detecting mispricing during volatility regimes. Future iterations should implement the complete multi-dimensional framework to properly test the hypothesis.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current results show promise but need refinement: 1) The improved IC and returns suggest divergence signals work, but the drawdown increase indicates risk management issues. 2) The hypothesis was only partially tested - we need the sentiment-fundamental component. 3) Both implemented factors are relatively simple (character counts: IFM_15D ~180 chars, VSR_10D ~120 chars), which is good for avoiding overfitting. 4) The volatility factor should be modified to better align with the hypothesis's 'mispricing during volatility regimes' concept. 5) Future iterations should focus on: a) Implementing the missing sentiment-fundamental factor, b) Creating a combined signal from all three dimensions, c) Ensuring each factor remains simple (<150 chars), d) Adding risk controls to improve drawdown."

The technical factors performed worse than SOTA in portfolio metrics despite a slight IC improvement. This indicates that price volatility ratios and volume-price correlations are poor substitutes for actual supply chain relationships and operational complexity. The hypothesis remains plausible but requires proper fundamental data implementation rather than technical proxies.",

        "reason": "The slight IC improvement suggests there may be some signal in the technical approaches, but the poor portfolio performance indicates either: 1) The factors are overfitting to training data, or 2) The technical proxies are fundamentally misaligned with the intended concepts. Given the complexity of the original hypothesis requiring supply chain, operational, and governance data that isn't available, we should pivot to testing whether simpler technical factors can work. The current factors use multiple operations (TS_STD, TS_MEAN, TS_CORR, DELTA, RANK) which may be over-engineered. Next iteration should focus on drastically simplified versions of these concepts with shorter expressions (<150 characters) and fewer operations."

        "observations": "The current experiment tested two technical factors (Supply_Chain_Stability_Proxy_20D and Operational_Complexity_Proxy_15D) as proxies for the hypothesized fundamental concepts. The combined results show mixed performance: while IC (0.006065) slightly improved over SOTA (0.005798), all three portfolio performance metrics (max_drawdown, information_ratio, annualized_return) are worse than SOTA. This suggests the technical proxies are not effectively capturing the intended fundamental characteristics. The Governance_Transparency_Proxy_30D was not implemented, leaving the hypothesis partially untested.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current results REFUTE the hypothesis that technical proxies for supply chain stability and operational complexity can generate superior returns. The technical factors performed worse than SOTA in portfolio metrics despite a slight IC improvement. This indicates that price volatility ratios and volume-price correlations are poor substitutes for actual supply chain relationships and operational complexity. The hypothesis remains plausible but requires proper fundamental data implementation rather than technical proxies.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The slight IC improvement suggests there may be some signal in the technical approaches, but the poor portfolio performance indicates either: 1) The factors are overfitting to training data, or 2) The technical proxies are fundamentally misaligned with the intended concepts. Given the complexity of the original hypothesis requiring supply chain, operational, and governance data that isn't available, we should pivot to testing whether simpler technical factors can work. The current factors use multiple operations (TS_STD, TS_MEAN, TS_CORR, DELTA, RANK) which may be over-engineered. Next iteration should focus on drastically simplified versions of these concepts with shorter expressions (<150 characters) and fewer operations."

This suggests the hypothesis has merit but implementation needs refinement.

The best performer (VolRegime_Momentum_Composite_5_1_5_20) achieves superior annualized return (7.35% vs 5.20%) and information ratio (1.00 vs 0.97), but suffers from worse max drawdown (-8.26% vs -7.26%). This suggests the hypothesis has merit but implementation needs refinement. The complexity analysis reveals significant issues: all factors have high symbol length (SL > 250), excessive base features (ER > 6), and high parameter counts (PC > 50%), indicating severe overfitting risk. The IC improvement (0.0072 vs 0.0058) is minimal, suggesting weak predictive power despite decent portfolio metrics.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis that combining volatility regime stress with momentum alignment can improve returns receives partial support. The best factor shows improved annualized return and information ratio, confirming that conditional momentum amplification during volatility transitions can enhance performance. However, the worse max drawdown indicates increased risk during adverse periods. The minimal IC improvement suggests the factor's predictive power remains weak. The critical issue is implementation complexity - all factors show classic overfitting signatures (long expressions, many features, high parameter counts) that will likely cause catastrophic test performance degradation.",

        "reason": "The current implementations are over-engineered with excessive complexity (SL > 250, ER > 6, PC > 50%). Research shows simpler factors with 50-150 character expressions using 2-4 core features generalize better. The hypothesis should focus on: 1) Reducing to 1-2 volatility measures (5-day vs 20-day STD ratio), 2) Using simple momentum (20-day return), 3) Applying binary or linear weighting instead of complex conditional logic, 4) Eliminating nested functions like RSI and multiple SIGN operations. This addresses the primary cause of poor test performance while maintaining the core volatility-momentum interaction concept."

The new hypothesis simplifies by: combining components before ranking, using fixed but reasonable time windows (5, 7, 20 days), and creating a single composite factor. This addresses the core idea while reducing implementation complexity.

        "observations": "The combined results from the three factor components show mixed performance compared to SOTA. While the current approach demonstrates some potential, it falls short of the comprehensive regime-adaptive microstructure dislocation factor described in the hypothesis. The IC (0.005278) is slightly lower than SOTA (0.005798), indicating weaker predictive correlation. More significantly, the information ratio (0.402786 vs 0.972561) and annualized return (0.031196 vs 0.052010) are substantially worse, while the max drawdown is more negative (-0.151274 vs -0.072585). This suggests the current implementation lacks the integrated, multi-timescale approach needed for the hypothesis.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis proposes a sophisticated regime-adaptive factor combining microstructure dislocation, sentiment-driven reversals, and fundamental stability across multiple timescales. However, the current implementation tests these components separately rather than as an integrated system. The results refute the hypothesis in its current form - the individual components do not collectively achieve the desired performance. The hypothesis may still be valid, but requires proper integration of the components with dynamic weighting and regime detection mechanisms. The current factors appear to be simple standalone measures rather than the adaptive system described.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current approach fails because: 1) Components are tested separately rather than integrated, 2) Each component uses cross-sectional ranking independently, losing relative scale information, 3) No dynamic adaptation or regime detection is implemented, 4) The complexity of individual factors may be insufficient for the sophisticated hypothesis. The new hypothesis simplifies by: combining components before ranking, using fixed but reasonable time windows (5, 7, 20 days), and creating a single composite factor. This addresses the core idea while reducing implementation complexity. The formula would be: Composite = w1 * (TS_MEAN(return,5)/(TS_STD(close,5)+ε)) + w2 * (TS_MEAN(ABS(return),20)/(TS_STD(close,20)+ε)) + w3 * TS_CORR(return, DELTA(volume,1)/(volume+ε), 7), then apply RANK(Composite). This creates a truly integrated factor under 150 characters."

While the current approach demonstrates some potential, it falls short of the comprehensive regime-adaptive microstructure dislocation factor described in the hypothesis. The IC (0.005278) is slightly lower than SOTA (0.005798), indicating weaker predictive correlation. More significantly, the information ratio (0.402786 vs 0.972561) and annualized return (0.031196 vs 0.052010) are substantially worse, while the max drawdown is more negative (-0.151274 vs -0.072585). This suggests the current implementation lacks the integrated, multi-timescale approach needed for the hypothesis.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis proposes a sophisticated regime-adaptive factor combining microstructure dislocation, sentiment-driven reversals, and fundamental stability across multiple timescales. However, the current implementation tests these components separately rather than as an integrated system. The results refute the hypothesis in its current form - the individual components do not collectively achieve the desired performance. The hypothesis may still be valid, but requires proper integration of the components with dynamic weighting and regime detection mechanisms. The current factors appear to be simple standalone measures rather than the adaptive system described.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current approach fails because: 1) Components are tested separately rather than integrated, 2) Each component uses cross-sectional ranking independently, losing relative scale information, 3) No dynamic adaptation or regime detection is implemented, 4) The complexity of individual factors may be insufficient for the sophisticated hypothesis. The new hypothesis simplifies by: combining components before ranking, using fixed but reasonable time windows (5, 7, 20 days), and creating a single composite factor. This addresses the core idea while reducing implementation complexity. The formula would be: Composite = w1 * (TS_MEAN(return,5)/(TS_STD(close,5)+ε)) + w2 * (TS_MEAN(ABS(return),20)/(TS_STD(close,20)+ε)) + w3 * TS_CORR(return, DELTA(volume,1)/(volume+ε), 7), then apply RANK(Composite). This creates a truly integrated factor under 150 characters."

        "observations": "The combined results show mixed performance across the three nested timeframe momentum factors. While the annualized return and IC improved compared to SOTA, the information ratio slightly declined and max drawdown worsened. This suggests that the hypothesis of coordinated information absorption across nested timeframes has partial merit, but the current factor implementations may not be capturing the optimal signal or may be introducing noise. The Nested_Momentum_Alignment_1_5_20 factor uses simple sign alignment, Multi_Horizon_Momentum_Correlation_10D adds correlation measurement, and Momentum_Cascade_Strength_15D introduces volatility normalization - each representing different mathematical approaches to the same core concept.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support. The improved annualized return (0.070630 vs 0.052010) and IC (0.006286 vs 0.005798) suggest that considering multiple timeframes together provides valuable predictive information beyond single-horizon momentum. However, the worsened max drawdown (-0.084862 vs -0.072585) and slightly lower information ratio (0.968682 vs 0.972561) indicate that the current implementations may be capturing some noisy signals or may not be properly managing risk during adverse periods. The mixed results suggest the core idea has potential but requires refinement in implementation.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current factors focus primarily on directional alignment (sign product) and correlation, but don't consider the magnitude consistency of the momentum signals. A factor that combines both direction AND magnitude alignment across timeframes, while also accounting for volatility conditions, may better capture true coordinated information absorption. The worsened max drawdown in current results suggests the factors may be signaling continuation during volatile periods where momentum is less reliable. Adding volatility filtering or normalization could improve risk-adjusted performance while maintaining the improved return potential."

The IC of 0.005145 indicates weak correlation with future returns, suggesting the current factor implementations capture only limited mispricing information. The information ratio (0.690 vs 0.973) and annualized return (0.040 vs 0.052) are significantly lower than SOTA, indicating inferior risk-adjusted performance. The hypothesis that abnormal volatility response contains predictive information receives weak support, but the current implementations are not optimal.",

However, the performance gap versus SOTA suggests the current factor constructions may not optimally capture the mispricing correction mechanism. The deviation-based approach (VSD_20D) and beta dispersion approach (VBD_40D) both underperform, indicating potential issues with: 1) window parameter selection, 2) volatility estimation methodology, or 3) the specific mathematical formulations. The hypothesis remains valid but requires better implementation.",

        "reason": "The original hypothesis mentioned sector volatility analysis but wasn't implemented. The current results show weak performance using only market volatility. By incorporating sector-relative measures, we may better isolate true abnormal sensitivity from normal sector characteristics. This dual-layer approach could: 1) reduce noise from sector-specific volatility patterns, 2) identify stocks with truly idiosyncratic risk mispricing, and 3) provide cleaner signals of systematic risk exposure errors. The reasoning follows from financial theory where risk exposure should be evaluated relative to both market and sector benchmarks."

The combined result shows mixed performance compared to SOTA. The annualized return (0.091473 vs 0.052010) and information ratio (1.059191 vs 0.972561) show clear improvements, while the max drawdown is worse (-0.132791 vs -0.072585). The IC is slightly better (0.006622 vs 0.005798). This suggests the factor combination captures some predictive signal but may be less robust during market downturns.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results partially support the hypothesis. The improved annualized return and information ratio indicate that combining cash flow stability proxies with valuation discount metrics and news impact signals can generate excess returns. However, the significantly worse max drawdown suggests the factor combination may be vulnerable during periods of market stress or when the hypothesized reversion fails to materialize. The cash flow stability proxy uses price-based volatility rather than fundamental cash flow data, which may limit its effectiveness. The valuation discount factor relies on price strength relative to 52-week highs, which may not fully capture 'valuation relative to historical norms' as specified in the hypothesis.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current results show promise but need refinement. The new hypothesis focuses on more measurable market-based signals rather than fundamental cash flow stability. The factor complexity should be reduced to avoid overfitting. The worse max drawdown suggests the current combination may be too sensitive to market conditions. A simpler, more robust implementation with fewer parameters and shorter expressions could improve generalization. The core insight - combining stability, discount, and temporary pressure signals - appears valid but needs cleaner implementation."

Both factors underperformed the SOTA results across all key metrics. The annualized return (0.051321 vs 0.052010), information ratio (0.795099 vs 0.972561), and IC (0.005565 vs 0.005798) are all lower than SOTA, while max drawdown is worse (-0.097225 vs -0.072585). This suggests the current implementations of the hypothesis are not effective. The Volume_Pressure_Volatility_Composite_10D factor was not implemented, so we cannot evaluate that variation.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis of combining microstructure liquidity stress with volatility regime detection for short-term reversals shows promise in theory but the current implementations need refinement. The poor performance indicates either: 1) The specific mathematical formulations are suboptimal, 2) The regime detection mechanisms are not effectively identifying favorable conditions, or 3) The signal scaling approach is not amplifying returns appropriately. The factors appear to be capturing some signal (positive IC) but not effectively translating it into portfolio performance.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show signs of overcomplexity with multiple nested operations, correlations, and conditional scaling. The symbol lengths appear excessive (likely >250 characters based on the formulations shown), which is a strong indicator of overfitting. The poor test performance despite theoretical sophistication suggests we need to simplify dramatically. A simpler approach focusing on core price-volume relationships with basic volatility adjustment may achieve better generalization. Specifically: 1) Use simple price-volume correlation or divergence, 2) Apply basic volatility normalization rather than complex regime detection, 3) Reduce lookback periods to 3-5 days, 4) Minimize cross-sectional operations and conditional logic."

However, risk-adjusted performance metrics (information ratio, annualized return) are significantly worse than SOTA, while the maximum drawdown is also worse. This indicates the current factors capture some signal but fail to translate it into profitable, robust strategies.",

However, the poor risk-adjusted returns suggest the factors may be capturing noise or are poorly constructed for portfolio formation. The factors tested (volume momentum, price range volatility, volume-return correlation) are simplistic proxies that don't directly measure 'social media sentiment' or 'institutional ownership equilibrium' as described in the hypothesis. The gap between the sophisticated hypothesis and the simple implementations suggests either: 1) the hypothesis needs simpler, more direct implementations, or 2) the available data (daily price/volume) is insufficient to test the full hypothesis.",

        "reason": "The current factors show predictive correlation (IC) but poor portfolio performance. This discrepancy often indicates overfitting or poor factor construction. The 'Price_Range_Volatility_Ratio_10D' factor description mentions complex components (social media sentiment, institutional ownership) but its implementation is a simple price range ratio - this mismatch suggests conceptual confusion. The best performing factor in concept was likely 'Volume_Acceleration_Return_Correlation_8D' which directly tests the relationship between volume changes and returns. Future iterations should: 1) Simplify factor expressions dramatically (target < 150 characters), 2) Focus on 2-4 core features instead of complex combinations, 3) Test clear, interpretable relationships like 'when volume accelerates in the direction of price movement, continuation is more likely', 4) Use consistent time windows (5D, 8D, 10D creates unnecessary variation)."

        "observations": "The current implementation of the regime-aware structural dislocation hypothesis shows mixed results. While the annualized return (6.70%) and IC (0.00625) outperform the SOTA (5.20% and 0.00580 respectively), the information ratio (0.846) and max drawdown (-15.14%) are worse than SOTA (0.973 and -7.26%). This suggests the factor captures some predictive signal but introduces higher volatility and worse risk-adjusted returns. The combination of three moderately complex factors may be creating noise rather than complementary signals. The IC improvement is modest (+7.8%) while the information ratio deterioration is significant (-13.0%), indicating the factor may be overfitting to noise rather than capturing persistent market inefficiencies.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis shows partial support - the regime-switching concept has merit as evidenced by improved annualized return and IC, but the implementation needs refinement. The current approach of combining three separate factors with different lookback periods (5D, 15D, 20D) creates timing misalignments and complexity. The volume-stress amplification and regime detection components appear to be adding noise rather than improving signal quality. The factor's poor risk-adjusted performance (lower information ratio, higher drawdown) suggests it's not effectively avoiding fading strong trends as intended. The modest IC improvement indicates the dislocation identification works to some degree, but the switching mechanism between mean-reversion and momentum needs optimization.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current implementation's complexity (three separate factors with different windows) likely causes overfitting and timing issues. A simpler unified approach could: 1) Reduce noise from multiple cross-sectional rankings, 2) Align timing windows for better regime synchronization, 3) Use fewer parameters to avoid overfitting. The new hypothesis focuses on core elements: price-volume divergence for dislocation detection and volatility-normalized returns for regime assessment. By combining these in a single expression with fewer free parameters, we aim to maintain the predictive signal while improving risk-adjusted returns. The simplification addresses the complexity concerns while preserving the regime-switching core concept."

        "observations": "The single implemented factor (RegimeAdaptive_EventAnticipation_20D) underperformed the SOTA across all key metrics, with particularly poor information ratio and IC. The factor was flagged for excessive complexity (8 base features vs. threshold of 6), indicating potential overfitting. The hypothesis of combining multiple information channels for corporate event anticipation with dynamic scaling was not effectively tested since only one simplified version was implemented.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current experiment does NOT support the original hypothesis. The implemented factor performed worse than SOTA in all metrics, suggesting that the specific combination of 20-day price-volume correlation scaled by inverse volatility is not effective for corporate event anticipation. The complexity warning indicates the factor may be over-engineered, which could explain poor generalization. However, the hypothesis cannot be fully refuted since only one of three proposed factors was implemented, and the implemented factor lacked key components from the hypothesis (financial ratios, order flow, bid-ask spread conditions).",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "1. The current factor's poor performance suggests excessive complexity is detrimental. 2. Price-volume correlation is a core concept worth exploring with simpler implementation. 3. Reducing lookback period from 20 to 10 days may capture more recent event anticipation signals. 4. Using cross-sectional rank instead of volatility scaling avoids additional parameters and reduces complexity. 5. This simpler approach (targeting <150 characters) addresses the complexity warning while maintaining the core idea of price-volume relationship for event anticipation."

While two metrics (information ratio and annualized return) show improvement over SOTA, the IC and max drawdown metrics deteriorated. The most concerning observation is the significant drop in IC from 0.005798 to 0.003878, indicating weaker predictive correlation despite better portfolio-level metrics. This suggests potential overfitting or implementation issues with the current factor constructions.",

The improved annualized return (0.080695 vs 0.052010) and information ratio (1.043342 vs 0.972561) suggest that incorporating institutional accumulation signals with regime amplification has merit for portfolio construction. However, the substantial decline in IC indicates that the factor's predictive power for individual stock returns has weakened. This could mean: 1) The factor captures portfolio-level effects better than stock-level predictions, 2) The implementation may be overfitting to noise, or 3) The hypothesis needs simplification to focus on core components. The worse max drawdown (-0.095209 vs -0.072585) also suggests increased risk during adverse periods.",

        "reason": "The current implementations show promise but suffer from complexity that likely contributes to the IC deterioration. The Institutional_Momentum_OFI_Composite_20D_5D factor has particularly concerning complexity with nested functions and conditional logic. The next iteration should focus on: 1) Drastically simplifying the factor expression (target < 150 characters), 2) Reducing the number of distinct raw features to 2-4 core components, 3) Eliminating conditional branches and complex regime detection, 4) Focusing on the most robust components: momentum + order flow imbalance + volatility scaling. The improved portfolio metrics suggest the core idea has value, but the implementation needs to be more parsimonious to improve predictive consistency and reduce overfitting."

However, the substantial decline in IC indicates that the factor's predictive power for individual stock returns has weakened. This could mean: 1) The factor captures portfolio-level effects better than stock-level predictions, 2) The implementation may be overfitting to noise, or 3) The hypothesis needs simplification to focus on core components.

The multiplicative interaction between regime transition probability and stress vulnerability appears to create a stronger signal than either component alone.

While it shows good performance, the complexity flags indicate potential overfitting. The next iteration should: 1) Simplify the mathematical expression to under 150 characters, 2) Reduce the number of distinct raw features from 5 to 3-4, 3) Use shorter windows (5-10 days instead of 10-15) for faster signal generation, 4) Eliminate conditional operations like MAX and SIGN, 5) Focus on the most impactful components: intraday volatility changes and negative return-volume correlation. This simplification should preserve the core insight while improving robustness."

        "hypothesis": "Hypothesis: A cross-sectional mean-reversion factor that identifies stocks experiencing temporary liquidity-driven price dislocations from their fundamental anchors, where the speed of reversion is accelerated by institutional ownership stability and suppressed by retail trading intensity, will generate consistent alpha by capturing systematic corrections to pricing errors.\n                Concise Observation: Parent momentum strategies show moderate IC but high IR, indicating trend-following works in stable regimes, but mean-reversion may capture alpha in volatile or overextended markets where prices disconnect from fundamentals.\n                Concise Justification: Liquidity shocks can cause temporary price dislocations from fundamentals; stable institutional ownership acts as an anchor, while high retail trading amplifies noise, slowing correction—this creates predictable reversion patterns exploitable for alpha.\n                Concise Knowledge: If a stock's price deviates significantly from its fundamental value, it tends to revert; when institutional ownership is stable, reversion is faster due to reduced selling pressure; and when retail trading intensity is high, reversion is slower due to noise and sentiment-driven trading.\n                concise Specification: The hypothesis tests if price deviations from fundamental anchors (e.g., price-to-book sector median) revert faster when institutional ownership is stable (low turnover) and slower when retail trading intensity (small trade volume ratio) is high, using a 20-day lookback for deviation and 60-day for ownership stability.\n                ",

The combined results show mixed performance: while annualized return (0.058571 vs 0.052010) and IC (0.006272 vs 0.005798) improved over SOTA, information ratio (0.773354 vs 0.972561) and max drawdown (-0.115168 vs -0.072585) deteriorated significantly. This suggests the current factors capture some mean-reversion signals but with higher volatility and worse risk-adjusted returns than the previous best approach.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results provide partial support for the hypothesis but reveal implementation issues. The improved IC and annualized return suggest the mean-reversion concept has merit, but the poorer information ratio and max drawdown indicate the current factor constructions may be capturing noise rather than systematic corrections. Specifically: 1) The retail trading adjustment in RNAR_20D appears too simplistic (just volume ratio), 2) OSAR_60D's use of volume-sequence correlation as a proxy for ownership stability is questionable and likely introduces noise, 3) Both factors lack proper sector-relative normalization mentioned in the hypothesis. The factors need refinement to better isolate liquidity-driven dislocations from fundamental anchors.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show promise (improved IC and return) but suffer from implementation complexity and questionable proxies. The new hypothesis focuses on simplification: 1) Replace questionable institutional ownership proxies with observable volume stability metrics, 2) Use price range deviations instead of arbitrary moving averages, 3) Emphasize volatility normalization to improve risk-adjusted returns. This addresses the poor information ratio and drawdown while maintaining the core mean-reversion concept. The factor should be significantly simpler (<150 characters) to avoid overfitting while capturing the essence of temporary price dislocations correcting toward equilibrium."

The combined results show mixed performance: while annualized return (0.058571 vs 0.052010) and IC (0.006272 vs 0.005798) improved over SOTA, information ratio (0.773354 vs 0.972561) and max drawdown (-0.115168 vs -0.072585) deteriorated significantly. This suggests the current factors capture some mean-reversion signals but with higher volatility and worse risk-adjusted returns than the previous best approach.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results provide partial support for the hypothesis but reveal implementation issues. The improved IC and annualized return suggest the mean-reversion concept has merit, but the poorer information ratio and max drawdown indicate the current factor constructions may be capturing noise rather than systematic corrections. Specifically: 1) The retail trading adjustment in RNAR_20D appears too simplistic (just volume ratio), 2) OSAR_60D's use of volume-sequence correlation as a proxy for ownership stability is questionable and likely introduces noise, 3) Both factors lack proper sector-relative normalization mentioned in the hypothesis. The factors need refinement to better isolate liquidity-driven dislocations from fundamental anchors.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show promise (improved IC and return) but suffer from implementation complexity and questionable proxies. The new hypothesis focuses on simplification: 1) Replace questionable institutional ownership proxies with observable volume stability metrics, 2) Use price range deviations instead of arbitrary moving averages, 3) Emphasize volatility normalization to improve risk-adjusted returns. This addresses the poor information ratio and drawdown while maintaining the core mean-reversion concept. The factor should be significantly simpler (<150 characters) to avoid overfitting while capturing the essence of temporary price dislocations correcting toward equilibrium."

The combined results show mixed performance: while annualized return (0.058571 vs 0.052010) and IC (0.006272 vs 0.005798) improved over SOTA, information ratio (0.773354 vs 0.972561) and max drawdown (-0.115168 vs -0.072585) deteriorated significantly. This suggests the current factors capture some mean-reversion signals but with higher volatility and worse risk-adjusted returns than the previous best approach.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results provide partial support for the hypothesis but reveal implementation issues. The improved IC and annualized return suggest the mean-reversion concept has merit, but the poorer information ratio and max drawdown indicate the current factor constructions may be capturing noise rather than systematic corrections. Specifically: 1) The retail trading adjustment in RNAR_20D appears too simplistic (just volume ratio), 2) OSAR_60D's use of volume-sequence correlation as a proxy for ownership stability is questionable and likely introduces noise, 3) Both factors lack proper sector-relative normalization mentioned in the hypothesis. The factors need refinement to better isolate liquidity-driven dislocations from fundamental anchors.",

The new hypothesis focuses on simplification: 1) Replace questionable institutional ownership proxies with observable volume stability metrics, 2) Use price range deviations instead of arbitrary moving averages, 3) Emphasize volatility normalization to improve risk-adjusted returns. This addresses the poor information ratio and drawdown while maintaining the core mean-reversion concept. The factor should be significantly simpler (<150 characters) to avoid overfitting while capturing the essence of temporary price dislocations correcting toward equilibrium."

The factor formulation appears to have implementation issues: it uses 'return_down' and 'return_up' which are not defined in the available variables, and the Amihud illiquidity calculation seems incorrectly implemented as LOG(ABS(return)/(volume×close)) instead of the standard TS_MEAN(ABS(return)/(volume×close), 20). This suggests the factor may not be correctly capturing the intended volatility asymmetry and liquidity interaction.",

The improved annualized return suggests there may be merit to the core idea, but the worse max drawdown and IC indicate the current implementation has risk management issues and weak predictive correlation. The factor needs correction to properly implement the theoretical concepts before the hypothesis can be properly tested.",

However, the factor needs simplification and correction: (1) Properly define downside returns (negative returns) and upside returns (positive returns) using available data, (2) Implement the standard Amihud illiquidity ratio as TS_MEAN(ABS(return)/(volume×close), 20), (3) Simplify the expression to avoid complexity overfitting. The new formulation should be: TS_VAR(return[return<0], 40) / (TS_VAR(return[return>0], 40) + 1e-8) × TS_MEAN(ABS(return)/(volume×close), 20). This captures the core interaction while being simpler and more interpretable."

While it achieves better annualized return (0.071788 vs 0.052010) and information ratio (1.112044 vs 0.972561), it performs worse on max drawdown (-0.099777 vs -0.072585) and IC (0.005386 vs 0.005798). The factor formulation appears to have implementation issues: it uses 'return_down' and 'return_up' which are not defined in the available variables, and the Amihud illiquidity calculation seems incorrectly implemented as LOG(ABS(return)/(volume×close)) instead of the standard TS_MEAN(ABS(return)/(volume×close), 20). This suggests the factor may not be correctly capturing the intended volatility asymmetry and liquidity interaction.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results provide partial support for the hypothesis that volatility asymmetry persistence combined with liquidity constraints can predict returns, but the implementation issues prevent definitive verification. The improved annualized return suggests there may be merit to the core idea, but the worse max drawdown and IC indicate the current implementation has risk management issues and weak predictive correlation. The factor needs correction to properly implement the theoretical concepts before the hypothesis can be properly tested.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factor shows promise in annualized return despite implementation errors, suggesting the core concept has potential. However, the factor needs simplification and correction: (1) Properly define downside returns (negative returns) and upside returns (positive returns) using available data, (2) Implement the standard Amihud illiquidity ratio as TS_MEAN(ABS(return)/(volume×close), 20), (3) Simplify the expression to avoid complexity overfitting. The new formulation should be: TS_VAR(return[return<0], 40) / (TS_VAR(return[return>0], 40) + 1e-8) × TS_MEAN(ABS(return)/(volume×close), 20). This captures the core interaction while being simpler and more interpretable."

        "observations": "The current experiment tested three variations of the hypothesis that a volatility regime filter (STD5/WVMA5) enhances different price signals. The combined results show mixed performance: the current experiment slightly outperforms SOTA in annualized return (+0.000248) and IC (+0.000906), but underperforms in information ratio (-0.173390) and max drawdown (+0.004121 worse). This suggests the regime filter concept has some merit but requires refinement. The volatility ratio appears to add value to reversal and momentum signals, but the current implementations may not fully capture the noise-driven regime filtering effect.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support. The improved IC (0.006704 vs 0.005798) indicates better alignment between predicted and actual returns when using the volatility regime filter. However, the worse information ratio suggests the factor adds more risk than return enhancement. The regime filter seems to work better with longer-term signals (ROC60 in RegimeFiltered_Reversal_5D) than with intraday support or short-term momentum. The mixed results suggest the mathematical formulation needs optimization - the simple multiplicative combination may not properly scale or weight the regime filter's effect.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current multiplicative approach assumes linear scaling of the regime filter's effect, which may over-amplify noise in certain market conditions. A normalized transformation (like RANK or logistic function) would bound the filter's influence between reasonable limits, preventing extreme values from dominating the signal. This should improve the information ratio by reducing excessive risk-taking during high-volatility periods while preserving the IC improvement. The transformation would also make the factor more robust across different market environments. Additionally, focusing on the 60-day reversal signal showed promise, suggesting longer-term mean reversion combined with short-term volatility regimes is a fruitful direction."

The combined results show mixed performance: the current experiment slightly outperforms SOTA in annualized return (+0.000248) and IC (+0.000906), but underperforms in information ratio (-0.173390) and max drawdown (+0.004121 worse). This suggests the regime filter concept has some merit but requires refinement. The volatility ratio appears to add value to reversal and momentum signals, but the current implementations may not fully capture the noise-driven regime filtering effect.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support. The improved IC (0.006704 vs 0.005798) indicates better alignment between predicted and actual returns when using the volatility regime filter. However, the worse information ratio suggests the factor adds more risk than return enhancement. The regime filter seems to work better with longer-term signals (ROC60 in RegimeFiltered_Reversal_5D) than with intraday support or short-term momentum. The mixed results suggest the mathematical formulation needs optimization - the simple multiplicative combination may not properly scale or weight the regime filter's effect.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current multiplicative approach assumes linear scaling of the regime filter's effect, which may over-amplify noise in certain market conditions. A normalized transformation (like RANK or logistic function) would bound the filter's influence between reasonable limits, preventing extreme values from dominating the signal. This should improve the information ratio by reducing excessive risk-taking during high-volatility periods while preserving the IC improvement. The transformation would also make the factor more robust across different market environments. Additionally, focusing on the 60-day reversal signal showed promise, suggesting longer-term mean reversion combined with short-term volatility regimes is a fruitful direction."

        "observations": "The current experiment tested three variations of the hypothesis that a volatility regime filter (STD5/WVMA5) enhances different price signals. The combined results show mixed performance: the current experiment slightly outperforms SOTA in annualized return (+0.000248) and IC (+0.000906), but underperforms in information ratio (-0.173390) and max drawdown (+0.004121 worse). This suggests the regime filter concept has some merit but requires refinement. The volatility ratio appears to add value to reversal and momentum signals, but the current implementations may not fully capture the noise-driven regime filtering effect.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support. The improved IC (0.006704 vs 0.005798) indicates better alignment between predicted and actual returns when using the volatility regime filter. However, the worse information ratio suggests the factor adds more risk than return enhancement. The regime filter seems to work better with longer-term signals (ROC60 in RegimeFiltered_Reversal_5D) than with intraday support or short-term momentum. The mixed results suggest the mathematical formulation needs optimization - the simple multiplicative combination may not properly scale or weight the regime filter's effect.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current multiplicative approach assumes linear scaling of the regime filter's effect, which may over-amplify noise in certain market conditions. A normalized transformation (like RANK or logistic function) would bound the filter's influence between reasonable limits, preventing extreme values from dominating the signal. This should improve the information ratio by reducing excessive risk-taking during high-volatility periods while preserving the IC improvement. The transformation would also make the factor more robust across different market environments. Additionally, focusing on the 60-day reversal signal showed promise, suggesting longer-term mean reversion combined with short-term volatility regimes is a fruitful direction."

        "observations": "The three factors tested represent partial implementations of the target hypothesis, focusing primarily on momentum acceleration and basic price-volume dynamics. The results show mixed performance: while the IC (0.007024) slightly outperforms SOTA (0.005798), key risk-adjusted metrics (information ratio: 0.640832 vs 0.972561; annualized return: 0.042622 vs 0.052010) are significantly worse. The max drawdown is also worse (-0.086733 vs -0.072585). This suggests the current implementations are capturing some predictive signal but lack robustness and risk management capabilities compared to the established benchmark. The factors appear to be over-engineered with complex expressions while missing critical components of the original hypothesis.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current results partially refute the implementation approach but not necessarily the core hypothesis. The poor performance on risk-adjusted metrics indicates that: 1) The simplified momentum acceleration signals alone are insufficient; 2) Missing institutional flow, governance/supply chain, and true regime adaptation components limits effectiveness; 3) Complex factor construction may be causing overfitting despite decent IC. The hypothesis requires more faithful implementation of its multi-source, regime-adaptive nature rather than just momentum acceleration variations.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show classic signs of overfitting: decent IC but poor out-of-sample performance on risk metrics. The expressions are complex (RAMAsymbol length ~200 characters, using multiple nested functions) while capturing only a fraction of the original hypothesis. The #1 priority must be simplification to improve generalization. A new factor should: 1) Use 2-3 core features instead of 6+; 2) Reduce expression length to <150 characters; 3) Focus on cross-sectional ranking rather than complex time-series operations; 4) Incorporate volume confirmation in a simple multiplicative way rather than through complex correlations and deltas. This approach maintains the momentum acceleration core while drastically reducing complexity."

        "observations": "The three factors tested represent partial implementations of the target hypothesis, focusing primarily on momentum acceleration and basic price-volume dynamics. The results show mixed performance: while the IC (0.007024) slightly outperforms SOTA (0.005798), key risk-adjusted metrics (information ratio: 0.640832 vs 0.972561; annualized return: 0.042622 vs 0.052010) are significantly worse. The max drawdown is also worse (-0.086733 vs -0.072585). This suggests the current implementations are capturing some predictive signal but lack robustness and risk management capabilities compared to the established benchmark. The factors appear to be over-engineered with complex expressions while missing critical components of the original hypothesis.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The current results partially refute the implementation approach but not necessarily the core hypothesis. The poor performance on risk-adjusted metrics indicates that: 1) The simplified momentum acceleration signals alone are insufficient; 2) Missing institutional flow, governance/supply chain, and true regime adaptation components limits effectiveness; 3) Complex factor construction may be causing overfitting despite decent IC. The hypothesis requires more faithful implementation of its multi-source, regime-adaptive nature rather than just momentum acceleration variations.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show classic signs of overfitting: decent IC but poor out-of-sample performance on risk metrics. The expressions are complex (RAMAsymbol length ~200 characters, using multiple nested functions) while capturing only a fraction of the original hypothesis. The #1 priority must be simplification to improve generalization. A new factor should: 1) Use 2-3 core features instead of 6+; 2) Reduce expression length to <150 characters; 3) Focus on cross-sectional ranking rather than complex time-series operations; 4) Incorporate volume confirmation in a simple multiplicative way rather than through complex correlations and deltas. This approach maintains the momentum acceleration core while drastically reducing complexity."

The hypothesis appears partially supported - the combination captures some mean-reversion potential during low-volatility regimes, but the lower IC suggests weaker predictive correlation with actual returns.

The strong information ratio and annualized return improvements suggest the combination of cash flow stability during price drops and low-volatility regime momentum has merit.

A simpler approach would: 1) Use raw return mean divided by return std for cash flow stability (no ranking/sign), 2) Use momentum directly adjusted by volatility regime (momentum * (1/volatility)), 3) Keep window sizes consistent (20D for both).

The new hypothesis focuses on simplification: 1) Reduce symbol length from 100+ characters to under 100, 2) Use fewer base features (2-3 instead of 3-4), 3) Minimize free parameters, 4) Focus on single, clear relationships rather than complex interactions.

All three factors share the same core components but differ in mathematical formulation and normalization methods. The results show mixed performance compared to SOTA, with improvements in some metrics but declines in others. The most concerning finding is that the Information_Asymmetry_Resolution_Factor, which has the highest complexity (longest expression, multiple operations), shows the worst performance, suggesting potential overfitting issues.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support. The concept of combining OFI, retail sentiment, and spread elements shows promise, as evidenced by improved information ratio and annualized return compared to SOTA. However, the IC metric (correlation between predicted and actual returns) declined slightly, indicating the factors may not be capturing the underlying return relationship as effectively as SOTA. The mixed results suggest the hypothesis is plausible but requires refinement in factor construction methodology. The poor performance of the most complex factor (Information_Asymmetry_Resolution_Factor) aligns with the complexity control warning - over-engineered factors often fail in out-of-sample testing.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show signs of over-complication: multiple nested functions, conditional operations (SIGN), and complex normalization schemes. The Information_Asymmetry_Resolution_Factor's poor performance despite its complexity suggests overfitting. The better-performing factors (OFI5_Retail_Sentiment_Spread_Interaction and Microstructure_Imbalance_Sentiment_Spread) are simpler but still contain unnecessary complexity. A radically simplified factor that captures the core interaction (positive institutional flow × negative retail sentiment) with minimal normalization should reduce noise and improve out-of-sample performance. The target should be a factor expression under 150 characters using only 3-4 core features."
