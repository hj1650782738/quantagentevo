The current implementation achieves better annualized return (0.064358 vs 0.052010) and information ratio (0.982739 vs 0.972561), indicating improved risk-adjusted returns. However, it suffers from worse maximum drawdown (-0.085155 vs -0.072585), suggesting higher downside risk. The IC improvement (0.006980 vs 0.005798) is marginal but positive. The hypothesis of integrating cross-asset spillover, microstructure signals, and liquidity conditioning shows promise but requires refinement to manage drawdowns better.",

The improved return metrics suggest that combining ETF flow spillover, opening imbalance synchronization, and liquidity stability momentum can generate alpha. However, the increased drawdown indicates that the current combination may amplify risk during adverse market conditions. The conditioning on liquidity stability (LSM_30D) might not be sufficient to mitigate downside risk effectively. The cross-sectional ranking approach in all factors may introduce excessive correlation among signals, potentially concentrating risk.",

This approach reduces free parameters and expression length, addressing potential overfitting while preserving the core multi-dimensional market dynamics insight."

The Information Ratio of 1.16 and annualized return of 7.4% are moderate but not exceptional. The IC of 0.0071 is particularly low, suggesting weak predictive power for future returns.

The proposed simplification removes the SIGN function, uses volume stability as a smoothing denominator rather than multiplicative component, and maintains the core interaction between price reversal and correlation. This should reduce complexity while preserving the intended signal. The volume standard deviation in the denominator (with +1 to avoid division by zero) will penalize stocks with erratic volume patterns without creating extreme values."

However, it underperforms in information ratio (0.91 vs 0.97) and max drawdown (-9.10% vs -7.26%), indicating risk management issues.

However, the deterioration in information ratio and max drawdown suggests the implementation may be capturing noise along with signal, or that the interaction between components isn't optimally calibrated. The volume stability factor may not be effectively filtering for 'quality institutional flows' as intended, potentially allowing noisy volume patterns to degrade the combined signal.",

        "reason": "The current implementation shows promise but needs refinement. Instead of volume stability (z-score of volume variance), which may not distinguish between informative and uninformative institutional flows, we should test volume directionality. The new hypothesis focuses on whether volume increases when convergence is positive (closing near highs) versus negative (closing near lows). This directional alignment better captures 'efficient price discovery' where institutional activity confirms the convergence direction. This approach should improve information ratio by filtering out contradictory signals while maintaining the alpha generation capability demonstrated in the current results. The implementation should be simpler than the current three-factor combination to avoid overfitting risks."

These complex relationships may not generalize well. The new hypothesis proposes simpler, more direct measures: 1) Direct earnings momentum (price returns adjusted for volume), 2) Direct volatility reduction (ratio of short-term to long-term volatility), 3) Direct multi-timeframe momentum alignment (difference or ratio of momentum signals).

This suggests the multi-timeframe, regime-aware approach has merit, but requires refinement to better manage risk. The current implementation successfully demonstrates that combining microstructure order flow imbalances with fundamental valuation momentum, weighted by volatility regimes, can generate alpha. However, the increased drawdown indicates potential risk management issues or overfitting concerns that need to be addressed.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results partially support the hypothesis. The improved information ratio (1.23 vs 0.97) and annualized return (7.3% vs 5.2%) suggest the multi-timeframe, regime-aware approach adds value. The volatility regime switching appears to effectively weight signals, as evidenced by the IC improvement (0.0075 vs 0.0058). However, the worse maximum drawdown (-7.7% vs -7.3%) indicates the regime switching may not adequately protect during high-volatility periods or that the factor combination amplifies risks. The hypothesis needs refinement to better address risk management within the regime-switching framework.",
        "decision": true,
        "reason": "The current implementation shows promise but needs simplification and better risk management. The slightly worse drawdown suggests the regime switching isn't adequately controlling risk during turbulent periods. The new hypothesis proposes: 1) Simplifying the order flow factor to reduce complexity and potential overfitting, 2) Adding momentum filtering to the fundamental factor to avoid buying into deteriorating trends, 3) Making the volatility regime detection asymmetric to be more responsive to increasing volatility, and 4) Incorporating explicit risk controls. This maintains the core multi-timeframe, regime-aware concept while addressing the observed weaknesses. The focus should be on creating simpler, more robust factors that are less likely to overfit."

When volatility is high, price movements may be noise-driven, making the residual-shadow relationship less reliable. The inverse adjustment gives more weight to signals during low-volatility periods where price action is cleaner and more meaningful. This aligns with the observation that the volatility-adjusted factor achieved better annualized return and information ratio while maintaining reasonable IC. The approach of using volatility as a weighting mechanism rather than a direct multiplicative component appears more effective."

        "observations": "The current experiment implemented two factors (Liquidity_Filtered_Reversion_10D and Regime_Aware_Volatility_Stability_15D) to test the hypothesis about sentiment-driven price dislocations and mean reversion. The results show mixed performance compared to SOTA. The IC (0.005818) slightly outperforms SOTA (0.005798), indicating marginally better predictive correlation. However, all three portfolio performance metrics (max_drawdown, information_ratio, annualized_return) are significantly worse than SOTA. This suggests the current factor combination captures some signal but fails to translate it into effective portfolio performance.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support but requires refinement. The positive IC suggests the factors capture some mean reversion signal related to sentiment overreaction, but the poor portfolio metrics indicate implementation issues. Specifically: 1) The liquidity filtering approach (LFR_{10D}) may not effectively identify stocks with improving liquidity for price normalization. 2) The volatility stability measure (RAVS_{15D}) might not correctly filter for clean mean reversion regimes. 3) The combination of these two factors may not interact optimally.

The Liquidity_Filtered_Reversion_10D factor has moderate complexity (uses RANK, TS_MEAN, TS_CORR with two base features) while Regime_Aware_Volatility_Stability_15D is simpler. However, neither factor directly measures the core concept of 'sentiment overreaction to non-fundamental news events.' Future iterations should: 1) Implement the missing Sentiment_Overreaction_Reversal_5D factor with simpler formulation. 2) Simplify the liquidity filter to use volume change rather than correlation with returns. 3) Test volatility stability with shorter windows (5-10 days) for faster regime detection. 4) Consider combining signals additively rather than multiplicatively to reduce complexity."

This complexity likely introduced noise, estimation errors, and overfitting opportunities. The poor results suggest we need to start with simpler, more direct signals. A momentum acceleration factor with volume confirmation: 1) Uses only the stock's own price and volume data (avoiding proxy issues), 2) Focuses on a clear economic intuition (price acceleration indicates changing momentum), 3) Includes volume as a confirming signal (higher conviction in price moves), 4) Can be implemented with minimal parameters and clear mathematical formulation. This approach reduces complexity while maintaining a theoretically sound basis for alpha generation."

This focuses on the most promising aspect of the original hypothesis - combining slow structural inefficiencies with liquidity stability - without the potentially diluting volatility regime signal. The simplified formulation should be: F = RANK(TS_PCTCHANGE(close, 60) / (TS_STD(return, 60) + ε)) × INV(TS_STD(volume, 5) + ε).

        "observations": "The current experiment tested two factors from the hybrid hypothesis: Volatility_Regime_Switching_Factor_5D and Intraday_Support_Momentum_Factor_5D. The combined results show mixed performance compared to SOTA. The annualized return (0.062367 vs 0.052010) and IC (0.006449 vs 0.005798) improved over SOTA, indicating better predictive power and overall returns. However, the information ratio (0.749333 vs 0.972561) and max drawdown (-0.118752 vs -0.072585) deteriorated significantly, suggesting higher risk and worse risk-adjusted returns. The third factor (Overnight_Gap_Mean_Reversion_Factor_5D) was not implemented, leaving a gap in testing the full hypothesis.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The results partially support the hypothesis but reveal critical issues. The improved annualized return and IC suggest that combining mean-reversion in high-volatility regimes with momentum in low-volatility regimes has merit for generating returns. However, the worse risk metrics (information ratio and max drawdown) indicate that the current implementations introduce excessive risk or instability. The factors likely suffer from overfitting due to their complexity: they use multiple conditional branches, ranking operations, and cross-sectional dependencies that may not generalize well. The regime-switching logic in Volatility_Regime_Switching_Factor_5D may create abrupt signal changes that increase volatility. The volume confirmation in Intraday_Support_Momentum_Factor_5D (SIGN(DELTA(volume, 1))) is too simplistic and may add noise rather than filter false signals.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show promise in returns but poor risk metrics, likely due to over-complexity and abrupt regime switches. Simplifying the approach can reduce overfitting and improve generalization. Instead of conditional branching, use a continuous function (e.g., sigmoid) to blend mean-reversion and momentum based on volatility levels. Replace cross-sectional ranking with time-series normalization to avoid dependency on daily cross-sectional distributions. Use simpler volume confirmation (e.g., volume relative to its moving average) rather than daily changes. Focus on a single core idea: volatility-adjusted price deviation combined with smoothed momentum, with a window of 5-10 days for stability. This should retain the hypothesis's core while reducing complexity and improving risk-adjusted performance."

        "observations": "The current experiment only tested the Governance_Momentum_Residual_60D factor, which represents just one component of the comprehensive multi-frequency, regime-aware hypothesis. The results show mixed performance: the factor achieved better annualized return (0.067898 vs 0.052010) and information ratio (1.138001 vs 0.972561) than SOTA, but worse max drawdown (-0.088598 vs -0.072585) and IC (0.005408 vs 0.005798). This suggests that while the governance transparency signal captures some predictive power for returns, it lacks robustness during market stress and has weaker correlation with actual returns.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The partial implementation provides limited support for the hypothesis. The governance component alone shows promise in generating excess returns, but the absence of microstructure asymmetry and regime-aware weighting components prevents a full evaluation. The hypothesis posits that combining multiple signals would create superior risk-adjusted returns, but we only tested one long-term fundamental component. The mixed results indicate that governance transparency signals have value but need complementary short-term and regime-adaptive components to achieve the hypothesized superior performance.",

        "reason": "The current factor shows potential but needs simplification to avoid overfitting risks. The REGRESI function with SEQUENCE creates unnecessary complexity. A simpler approach using TS_SLOPE for trend estimation would reduce symbol length while preserving the governance momentum concept. Additionally, combining with a volatility adjustment component (using TS_STD of returns) could improve robustness without adding excessive complexity. Shorter lookback periods (20-30 days instead of 60) may provide better signal-to-noise ratio. The new hypothesis focuses on capturing governance transparency through price trend quality rather than regression residuals, making it more interpretable and less prone to overfitting."

The superior performance of the current combined result suggests that the direct, unranked interaction of signals (as implied by the hypothesis) may be even more potent.

The main hypothesis factor (RegimeAdaptive_Composite_60_20_5) was not implemented, so we cannot fully test the core idea of dynamic regime-switching between long-term composite and short-term acceleration signals.",
        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The partial implementation provides limited support for the hypothesis. The VolatilityRegime_Weighted_ROC60_CORR20 factor shows promise with its dynamic weighting mechanism, but the results are not strong enough to confirm the superiority of regime-adaptive approaches. The hypothesis needs refinement: 1) The regime-switching mechanism may be too complex; 2) The combination of multiple signals might create noise rather than synergy; 3) The volatility trend as regime indicator may not be optimal. The current results suggest that simpler versions of these concepts might perform better.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show moderate performance but with concerning complexity (especially VolatilityRegime_Weighted_ROC60_CORR20). The core insight - that different market regimes favor different types of signals - appears valid, but the implementation is over-engineered. The next iteration should: 1) Simplify the weighting function to use basic thresholding instead of sigmoid; 2) Reduce the number of lookback periods; 3) Test individual components separately before combining; 4) Focus on cleaner mathematical expressions. This approach addresses the complexity concerns while preserving the regime-adaptive concept."

        "hypothesis_evaluation": "The hypothesis receives partial support - the factors demonstrate ability to generate higher annualized returns, suggesting the multi-regime conditioning approach can identify profitable opportunities during fragile liquidity periods. However, the deterioration in information ratio and IC indicates the factors may be capturing noise alongside signal, or that the regime detection mechanisms need refinement. The cross-asset spillover factor (CSOF_20D) shows promise but likely requires more sophisticated spillover measurement. The volume-stability normalization appears effective but may benefit from alternative normalization approaches. The regime-aware flow imbalance factor's complexity (nested TS functions) raises overfitting concerns despite its theoretical appeal.",
        "decision": false,
        "reason": "The current factors show potential but suffer from complexity issues (particularly RAFI_5D with nested TS_STD and TS_MEAN functions). The new hypothesis focuses on: 1) Simplifying the factor construction to avoid overfitting while maintaining the core regime-aware concept; 2) Using adaptive window sizes that respond to volatility rather than fixed periods; 3) Combining price momentum with volume confirmation rather than complex normalization schemes; 4) Focusing on institutional footprint through price-volume relationships rather than multiple conditioning layers. This approach should reduce complexity (targeting <150 characters), improve test performance, and maintain the regime-sensitive characteristics that showed promise in generating higher returns."
