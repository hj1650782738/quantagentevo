\begin{abstract}
Factor mining in quantitative investment is notoriously difficult due to low signal-to-noise ratios, strong non-stationarity, and frequent market regime shifts, where single-period in-sample backtesting is insufficient to establish robustness. Recent LLM- and agent-based approaches improve automation but struggle to conduct constrained, multi-round searches that prioritize out-of-sample stability under realistic financial constraints.
We propose \textbf{QuantaAlpha}, a hypothesis-centric self-evolving framework for factor mining. The framework formulates factor discovery as a constrained black-box search problem and treats research hypotheses as evolutionary individuals. A planning module initializes hypothesis populations, which are iteratively refined through orthogonal mutation, crossover, and hybrid selection under explicit complexity constraints in a nested closed-loop process.
Experiments on the CSI 300 stock universe demonstrate that QuantaAlpha consistently yields more stable and generalizable factor pools than existing baselines. Additional analyses on ablation, alpha decay, and factor diversity further validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.
